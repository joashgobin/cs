# 4.1 Dynamics - Motion In a Straight Line
**Kinematics** is the study of the motion of objects without referring to the forces which are responsible for this motion.

## Distance and displacement
- **Distance** is ==the length of a path between two points==. It has *no direction* and thus it is a scalar quantity
- **Displacement** is ==how far an object is moved from its original position in a straight line==. It implies *movement in a specific direction* and so we consider it to be a vector quantity
- Both have the metre (m) as their SI unit
- Displacement is the vector equivalent of distance

## Speed and velocity
- Speed is the distance travelled per unit time:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
speed=\frac{distance}{time}\rightarrow \frac{m}{s}\ OR\ ms^{-1}
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
- It is comprised of two scalar quantities (distance and time) and thus it will be scalar quantity itself
- Velocity is the displacement an object undergoes per unit time:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
velocity(v)=\frac{displacement}{time}\rightarrow \frac{m}{s}\ OR\ ms^{-1}
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
- It is comprised of a vector (displacement) and a scalar (time). It inherits the direction from the displacement thus it is a vector

## Acceleration
- Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
acceleration(a)=\frac{change\ in\ velocity}{change\ in\ time}=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v-u}{\Delta t}
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
- The SI unit for acceleration is $ms^{-2}$ or alternatively $Nkg^{-1}$
- It is a vector as velocity is a vector

## Displacement-time graphs
- These describe the displacement of an object over a time interval
- Displacement (the dependent variable) is on the y axis
- Time (the independent variable) is on the x axis
- The gradient of the graph at any point in time tells us the velocity of the object:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
gradient(m)=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{\Delta displacement}{\Delta time}=velocity
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$

Let us describe the graph in terms of how displacement and velocity vary:

## Velocity-time graphs
- These graphs describe the velocity of an object over a time interval
- Velocity (the dependent variable) is on the y axis
- Time (the independent variable) is on the x axis
- The gradient of the graph at any point in time tells us the acceleration of the object:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
gradient(m)=\frac{rise}{run}=\frac{\Delta velocity}{\Delta time}=acceleration
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
- The area enclosed by the graph and the time axis (the x axis) is the displacement of the object

Let us describe the graph in terms of how velocity and acceleration vary and the total displacement:
