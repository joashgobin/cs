# 3.5 Levers
A lever is a *simple machine* consisting of a rigid bar (meaning it does not bend) which pivots at a certain point (**pivot/fulcrum**) along its length and by the effect of a force (called the **effort**), it can serve to move an object or overcome another force (referred to as the **load**). 

## Types of levers
There are ==three(3) types of levers==:
1. **First class** levers have the **fulcrum** in between the load and effort. These can be *force multipliers* or *distance multipliers*
2. **Second class** levers have the **load** in between the fulcrum and effort. These are *force multipliers*
3. **Third class** levers have the **effort** in between the fulcrum and load. These are *distance multipliers*
