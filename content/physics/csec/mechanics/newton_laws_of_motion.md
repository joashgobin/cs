# 4.4 Newton's Laws of Motion
**Dynamics** is the branch of mechanics concerned with the forces which cause motion. We study Newton's three(3) laws of motion in dynamics. These laws are:
1. *First law*: An object in uniform motion, or at rest, will continue in its state of uniform motion, or rest, unless acted upon by an ==unbalanced external force==. This is also referred to as the **Law of Inertia**.
2. *Second law*: The rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of that force. The corresponding formula is
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
Net\ force&=mass\times acceleration
\\F_{net}&=ma\\
F_{net}&=m(\frac{v-u}{t})\\
F_{net}&=\frac{mv-mu}{t}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
3. *Third law*: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.

## A note on mass
Mass is the amount of matter present in an object, substance or system. It is a measure of **inertia**. Inertia is the ability of a body to resist changes in motion. Heavier bodies are better at resisting changes in motion because they have more mass. For example, a boulder has more inertia than a table tennis ball (in other words, it has more mass).

## Applying the laws of motion
The laws of motion are commonly used in conjunction with each other. The calculations associated with the first law of motion are addressed in the lesson on linear momentum.

### Examples
Below are examples of the laws of motion being applied.
#### Example 1
A block of mass $9.0\ kg$ is pulled across the floor using a horizontal rope. If the tension in the rope is $29\ N$ and the frictional force is $17\ N$, calculate the acceleration of the block.

According to Newton's 2nd law:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
F_{net}&=ma\\
where\ F_{net}&=29\ N+(-17\ N)=12\ N\\
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
Finding for acceleration:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
a&=\frac{F_{net}}{m}\\
&=\frac{12\ N}{9.0\ kg}\\
&=1.33\ Nkg^{-1}\\&\ \ \ \ \ \ OR\ 1.33\ ms^{-2}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
#### Example 2
An apple of mass $100\ g$ rests on a table. What is the reaction force the table exerts onto the apple?

According to Newton's 3rd law,
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
reaction\ force(R)&=weight\ of\ the\ apple(W)\\
&=mg\\
&=0.1\ kg\times 9.81\ ms^{-2}\\
R&=0.981\ N
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
