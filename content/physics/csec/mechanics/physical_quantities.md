# 1.1 Physical Quantities
A physical quantity is a **property** of a material, substance or system which can be **measured/quantified**. Examples include the **mass** of a ball and the **volume** of a gas.

## Fundamental quantities/Base quantities
These are the physical quantities from which all other physical quantities are derived. According to the International System of Units (SI), there are **seven (7)** fundamental quantities:

| Quantity            | Symbol | Unit     | Abbreviation for unit |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------ |
| Mass                | $m$    | kilogram | $kg$   |
| Length              | $l$    | metre    | $m$    |
| Time                | $t$    | second   | $s$    |
| Temperature         | $T$    | Kelvin   | $K$    |
| Amount of substance | $n$    | mole     | $mol$  |
| Current             | $I$    | ampere   | $A$    |
| Luminous intensity  | $I_v$  | candela  | $cd$       |

## Derived quantities
These are ==combinations== of the fundamental quantities. The following are examples of derived quantities. Note the fundamental quantities which are involved in each.
$$\begin{gathered}
area=length\times width
\end{gathered}$$
Width is a **length measurement** and is essentially *Length* disguised under another word. This would mean that height, breadth, distance, displacement, perimeter and circumference are also length measurements (they fall under the fundamental quantity *Length*).
$$\begin{gathered}
volume=length\times width\times height\\
OR\\
volume=area\times height
\end{gathered}$$
Notice that area is a derived quantity. Thus volume can be seen as the **product of** three fundamental quantities (**length, width and height**) or as the **product of** a derived quantity (**area**) and a fundamental quantity (**height**).

Let's look at some other examples.
$$\begin{aligned}speed&=\frac{distance}{time}\\
velocity&=\frac{displacement}{time}\\
acceleration&=\frac{velocity}{time}\\
force&=mass\times acceleration\\
pressure&=\frac{force}{area}
\end{aligned}$$
### Finding the units of derived quantities
We can find the units of derived quantities if we substitute the units of the other quantities which make it up:
$$\begin{gathered}
speed=\frac{distance}{time}\rightarrow \frac{m}{s}\ OR\ ms^{-1}
\end{gathered}$$
#### Mission details
Find the units of the previously listed derived quantities by making use of their formulae.
