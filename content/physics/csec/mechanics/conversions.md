# 1.6 The Best Way To Do Conversions
Recall that when doing standard form, we can shift the decimal point to the left and increase the power of 10. We can also shift the decimal point to the right and decrease the power of 10. Doing these in the opposite order is also valid:
>If we **increase the power** of 10 by 1 then we MUST shift the decimal point **to the left** by 1 digit
>If we **decrease the power** of 10 by 1 then we MUST shift the decimal point **to the right** by 1 digit

The following method of doing conversions exploits these two rules.

## Converting from one unit to another
Let's look at a few examples.
1. Convert 5 Mg to kg
We write 5 Mg with the prefix as a power of $10$:
$$\begin{gathered}
5\ Mg\rightarrow5\times 10^6\ g
\end{gathered}$$
Recall that *kilo-* means $10^3$ so we make the $10^6$ into $10^3$, shifting the decimal point as necessary:

$$\begin{gathered}
5.0\times 10^6\ g\rightarrow5,000\times 10^3\ g
\end{gathered}$$
>We **decreased** the power of 10 by 3 so we MUST shift the decimal point to the **right** by 3 digits

Swap $10^3$ for *kilo-*:
$$\begin{gathered}
5,000\times 10^3\ g\rightarrow5,000\ kg
\end{gathered}$$
2. Convert 3 mg to kg
Writing prefix as a power of 10:
$$\begin{gathered}
3\ mg\rightarrow3\times 10^{-3}\ g
\end{gathered}$$
Making $10^{-3}$ into $10^3$ since *kilo-* means $10^3$, shifting the decimal point as necessary:
![[1.6 The Best Way To Do Conversions 2022-09-17 11.45.31.excalidraw|x400]]
$$\begin{gathered}
3\times10^{-3}\ g\rightarrow 0.000003 \times 10^3\ g
\end{gathered}$$
>We **increased** the power of 10 by 6 so we MUST shift the decimal point to the **left** by 6 digits

Swap $10^3$ for *kilo-*:
$$\begin{gathered}
0.000003\times 10^3\ g\rightarrow 0.000003\ kg
\end{gathered}$$

#### Mission details
Convert the following:
1. $13\ kg\ to\ mg$
2. $20\ mg\ to\ kg$
3. $2.47\ kg\ to\ Mg$
4. $0.0037\ kg\ to\ mg$
5. $1,200,000,000,000\ ng\ to\ kg$
