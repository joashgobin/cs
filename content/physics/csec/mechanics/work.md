# 5.2 Work
This is the **product of** the **force applied** to an object and the **distance the object moves** ==in the direction of the force==:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
work&=force\times distance\\
&=Fd
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
The unit for work is the **Joule(J)**:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
work=Fd\rightarrow\ N\times m\rightarrow Nm\ OR\ J
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
It has the same unit as energy since energy is the ability to do work.
Note that the Newton-metre ($Nm$) is comprised of the fundamental units:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
Nm\rightarrow kgms^{-2}\times m\rightarrow kgm^2s^{-2}\equiv J
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

#### Example
A $5\ N$ force acting eastward is used to push a box by a distance of $7\ m$ in the east direction. Find the work done in order to move the box, assuming that the frictional force is negligible.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
work&=Fd\\
&=5\ N\times 7\ m\\
&=35\ Nm\ OR\ 35\ J
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
## Power
This is the energy converted or transferred per unit time:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
power&=\frac{energy}{time}\\
P&=\frac{E}{t}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
Looking at the units:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
P=\frac{E}{t}\rightarrow \frac{J}{s}\rightarrow Js^{-1}\ OR\ Watts(W)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

### The kilowatt-hour
This is a unit used to measure the amount of energy used. It is **NOT a measure of power**.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
P=\frac{E}{t}\rightarrow E&=Pt\\
\therefore E&=Pt\rightarrow kW\times h\rightarrow kWh
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
Thus the kilo-watt hour is the energy used if we run an appliance with a power rating of $1\ kW(1000\ W)$ for $1\ hr(3600\ s)$:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
1\ kWh&\rightarrow 1\ kW\times 1\ h\\
&=1,000\ W\times 3,600\ s\\
&=3,600,000\ Ws\\
&=3.6\times 10^6\ J\\
&=3.6\ MJ
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
>A **kilowatt-hour** is the same as **3.6 megajoules of energy**.

## Mechanical advantage (MA)
This is the ratio of the load to the effort. This quantity is dimensionless (no units):
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
MA&=\frac{load}{effort}\color{gray}\rightarrow \frac{N}{N}\rightarrow no\ units
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
#### Example
If a lever requires a input force of $1\ N$ to move a box of weight $5\ N$:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
MA&=\frac{load}{effort}\\
&=\frac{5\ N}{1\ N}\\
&=5
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

## Velocity Ratio (VR)
This is the ratio of the distance moved by the effort to the distance moved by the load:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
VR=\frac{distance\ moved\ by\ effort}{distance\ moved\ by\ load}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
#### Example
In the case of the lever previously mentioned, the effort would have to move by $5\ m$ in order to move the load by only $1\ m$ (if the system is 100% efficient):
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
VR&=\frac{distance\ moved\ by\ effort}{distance\ moved\ by\ load}\\
&=\frac{5\ m}{1\ m}\\
&=5
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

## Efficiency
This is the percentage ratio of the output to the input:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
efficiency&=\frac{output}{input}\times 100\%\\
&=\frac{work\ out}{work\ in}\times 100\%\\
&=\frac{power\ out}{power\ in}\times 100\%
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
Efficiency can also be written in terms of mechanical advantage and velocity ratio:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
efficiency=\frac{MA}{VR}\times 100\%
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

#### Example
A lever is used to move a box of weight $4\ N$ over a distance of $2\ m$. The force required to do so is $1\ N$ but it has to be applied over a distance of $9\ m$. Find the efficiency of the system.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
efficiency&=\frac{work\ out}{work\ in}\times 100\%\\
&=\frac{4\ N\times 2\ m}{1\ N\times 9\ m}\times 100\%\\
&=\frac{8\ Nm}{9\ Nm}\times 100\%\\
&=88.9\%
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
The system has an efficiency **less than 100%** thus it is **not ideal**.
