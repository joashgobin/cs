# 2.1 Scalars and Vectors
Physical quantities can be divided into:
1. ==Fundamental== quantities vs. ==derived== quantities **OR**
2. ==Scalar== quantities vs. ==vector== quantities

We have looked at the former pair of categories. Now we shall study the latter.

## Scalar quantities
Scalar quantities (or simply **scalars**) are physical quantities which have **magnitude** but **NO direction**. Examples include mass, length, time, distance and speed. When representing a scalar on a diagram, we simply write the measurement next to the corresponding object:

## Vector quantities
Vector quantities (or simply **vectors**) are physical quantities which have **both magnitude AND direction**. Examples include displacement, velocity, acceleration and force. We represent vectors with an arrow with the measurement next to it:

### Example: Distance vs. Displacement

### Sign conventions
A sign convention is a set of rules which specify the signs for certain directions. For example, a sign convention can dictate that on your book page all vectors going to the right are in the positive horizontal (x) direction and all vectors pointing downward are in the negative vertical (y) direction. In fact, the cartesian plane used in geometry does exactly that:

### Types of vectors
We can describe vectors in terms of **their direction**:
- horizontal
- vertical
- oblique

We can also describe them **relative to each other**:
- perpendicular vectors
- parallel vectors
- anti-parallel vectors

### Resolving vectors
Imagine you normally take the red path (**north-east**) but one day it rains heavily and the shortcut area is flooded. How far would you have to walk **east**? How far would you have to walk **north**?
![[2.1 Scalars and Vectors 2022-10-08 10.56.51.excalidraw]]

Any vector can be resolved into **two (2) perpendicular components**. The angle ($\theta$) that a vector forms with the horizontal or vertical must be known.

![[2.1 Scalars and Vectors 2022-10-01 09.44.13.excalidraw]]

>The **adjacent component** is always $Rcos\theta$
>The **other component** is always $Rsin\theta$

#### Example
![[2.1 Scalars and Vectors 2022-10-08 12.15.37.excalidraw]]

When we resolve vectors we are asking which two vectors can be used to ==replace the original== vector. These two vectors **MUST** have the same overall effect as the original.

>The *components of a vector* **are** themselves **vectors**

#### Mission details
Resolve the following vectors into two perpendicular components.
