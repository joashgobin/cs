# 3.1 Forces
A force can be defined as a push or a pull. It is an **action** which causes a change in **shape**, **size** or **motion** of an object or system. Force is measured in Newtons (N).

## Types of forces
Forces are divided into two groups:
1. ==Contact forces== - these require the objects involved in the interaction to be *in physical contact* with each other. Examples include:
	- friction
	- tension
	- air resistance
2. ==Non-contact forces== - these can be applied *at a distance*, requiring no contact between the object **exerting** the force and the object **experiencing** the force. Examples include:
	- gravitational force (between any two bodies with mass)
	- magnetic force (between magnetic materials)
	- electric force (between charged bodies)

### Weight
Weight is the force exerted by the Earth (or another planetary body) on the objects within its **gravitational field**. It can also be thought of as the force exerted by a body on another body which is **supporting it** – assuming that the bodies are within a gravitational field. Weight can be calculated as the product of the object’s mass and the Earth’s gravitational acceleration ($g$):
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
Weight=mass\times acceleration\ due\ to\ gravity\\
OR\\
W=mg
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
>Recall that $g$ is approximately $9.81\ ms^{-2}$.
