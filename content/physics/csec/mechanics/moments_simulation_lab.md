# 3.4 Principle of Moments Simulation Lab
The following lab can be replicated in person using a metre rule, masses with mass holders and a glass prism to act as the base.

**THEORY**:
The principle of moments states that for a body **in equilibrium**, the *sum of anti-clockwise moments* equals the *sum of clockwise moments*:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
\sum ACW\ moments=\sum CW\ moments
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
A system can thus be made to be in equilibrium by ensuring that these sums are balanced.

**AIM**: To verify the validity of the principle of moments

**MATERIALS/APPARATUS**: PhET balancing act simulation (https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/balancing-act/latest/balancing-act_en.html)

**METHOD**:
1. Choose the 'Balance Lab' option
2. Click the switch to remove the pillars under the beam
3. Under the position section, choose the 'Rulers' option
4. Place a 20 kg mass on the left side at a distance of 0.25 m away from the pivot
5. Place a 10 kg mass on the right side so as to make the beam level again
6. Record each mass and its distance away from the pivot
7. Repeat steps 4 to 6, placing the 20 kg mass on the left side at distances ranging from 0.5 m to 2 m at regular intervals of 0.25 m. Use multiple masses (except for a 20 kg mass) on the right hand side when the left hand side moment becomes too large

**RESULTS**:

**DATA ANALYSIS**:
1. For each row in the results table, calculate the sum of anti-clockwise moments
2. For each row in the results table, calculate the sum of clockwise moments
3. For each row, compare the sums
