# 5.1 Energy
Energy is ==the ability to do work==. It has the same SI unit as work - **Joules(J)**.
Some forms of energy are:
- gravitational potential
- kinetic
- elastic
- chemical
- electrical
- magnetic
- electromagnetic (light)
- thermal
- nuclear
- sound

## Law of conservation of energy
Energy is neither created nor destroyed but it changes in form.

### Examples of energy conversion
- In an ==electric motor==, *electrical energy* from the battery is transformed into *kinetic energy* of the rudder
- In a ==hydroelectric dam==, the *gravitational potential energy* of the water at the top of the dam is converted to *kinetic energy* as the water falls to the bottom and that is used to turn turbines which convert this kinetic energy to *electrical energy*
- In a ==battery==, *chemical energy* is converted to *electrical energy*
- In an ==incandescent light bulb==, *electrical energy* is converted to both *light energy* and *thermal energy*
- ==Speakers== convert *electrical* signals into *sound energy*
- When a ==vehicle== comes to a stop, its *kinetic energy* is converted to *thermal energy*
- When food is cooked in a ==microwave oven==, *electrical energy* is converted to *electromagnetic energy* and this in turn is converted into *thermal energy*
- ==Solar panels== convert *electromagnetic energy* from the sun into *electrical energy*
- *Kinetic energy* of wind is converted to *electrical energy* by ==wind turbines==

## Types of mechanical energy
Mechanical energy is divided into two (2) types:
1. Potential energy
2. Kinetic energy

### Potential energy
This is the energy a body possesses *by virtue of its position within a field or system or its state*. We will focus on **gravitational potential energy (GPE)** - the energy a body has ==by virtue of its position== in the Earth's ==gravitational field==. GPE is given by the formula
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
GPE=mgh
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
where $m$ is the object's mass, $g$ is acceleration due to gravity and $h$ is the height of the object above the **reference level**, usually taken as the ground.

A change in GPE is given by the formula
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\Delta GPE&=GPE_f-GPE_i\\
&=mgh_f-mgh_i\\
&=mg(h_f-h_i)\\
&=mg\Delta h
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

#### Example
A ball falls from a height of $5\ m$ to that of $3\ m$ above the ground. If the mass of the ball is $4\ kg$, find the change in gravitational potential energy.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\Delta GPE&=mg\Delta h\\
&=4\ kg\times9.81\ ms^{-2}\times(3\ m-5\ m)\\
&=-78.48\ kgm^2s^{-2}\ OR\ -78.48\ J
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
This means that the ball **lost $78.48\ J$ of GPE**.

### Kinetic energy
This is the energy a body possesses *by virtue of its motion*. The kinetic energy (KE) is dependent on the mass ($m$) and velocity ($v$) of the object:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
KE=\frac{1}{2}mv^2
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
A change in KE is given by the formula
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\Delta KE&=KE_f-KE_i\\&=\frac{1}{2}mv_f^2-\frac{1}{2}mv_i^2\\
&=\frac{1}{2}m(v_f^2-v_i^2)
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
#### Example
Find the kinetic energy of a ball of mass $2\ kg$ and velocity $4\ ms^{-1}$.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
KE&=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\
&=\frac{1}{2}(2\ kg)(4\ ms^{-1})^2\\
&=\frac{1}{2}(2\ kg)(16\ m^2s^{-2})\\
&=16\ kgm^2s^{-2}\ OR\ 16\ J
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

## Conservation of mechanical energy
If an object of mass $m$ is released from a height $h$, its potential energy is gradually converted to kinetic energy as it falls such that
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
GPE\ at\ the\ top&=KE\ at\ the\ bottom\\
mg\Delta h&=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\\
g\Delta h&=\frac{1}{2}v^2\\
v^2&=2g\Delta h\\
v&=\sqrt{2g\Delta h}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

#### Example 1
Find the final velocity of a box with mass $0.5\ kg$, just before it hits the ground, falling from a height of $3\ m$.
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
v&=\sqrt{2g\Delta h}\\
&=\sqrt{2(9.81\ ms^{-2})(3\ m-0\ m)}\\
&=\sqrt{58.86\ m^2s^{-2}}\\
&=7.67\ ms^{-1}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$

#### Example 2
What would be the height of release if the box were to have a final velocity of $9\ ms^{-1}$ just before it hits the ground?
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
v&=\sqrt{2g\Delta h}\\
\Delta h&=\frac{v^2}{2g}\\
h_2-h_1&=\frac{v^2}{2g}\\
h_2&=\frac{v^2}{2g}+h_1\\
h_2&=\frac{(9\ ms^{-1})^2}{2(9.81\ ms^{-2})}+0\ m\\
&=4.13\ m
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
>**The greater the height** the object is released from, **the greater the final velocity**.
