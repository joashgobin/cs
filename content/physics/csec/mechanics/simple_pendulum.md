# Simple Pendulum
A simple pendulum is a heavy mass (*called the bob*) attached to a light inextensible string.
Gravity acts as the **restoring force** and returns the pendulum to equilbrium 
(its resting position where the string is completely vertical).

The period ($T$) of a simple pendulum under ideal conditions is given by the formula:
$$T=\sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$

where $l$ is the length of the pendulum and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity.
$T$ is measured in seconds ($s$), $l$ in meters ($m$) and $g$ in meters per square second ($ms^{-2}$).
