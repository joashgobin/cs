# Simple Pendulum
A simple pendulum is a heavy mass (*called the bob*) attached to a light inextensible string.
Gravity acts as the **restoring force** and returns the pendulum to equilbrium 
(its resting position where the string is completely vertical).

An oscillation is a complete to and fro movement of the pendulum (the minimal repeating motion) e.g. a swing from left to right and back to left.

The period ($T$) of a simple pendulum is the time taken for it to complete one oscillation. Under ideal conditions, it is given by the formula:
$$T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}$$

where $l$ is the length of the pendulum and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity.
$T$ is measured in seconds ($s$), $l$ in meters ($m$) and $g$ in meters per square second ($ms^{-2}$).


#### Challenge
Using $g$ as $9.81\ ms^{-2}$, solve the following:
- Find the period of a simple pendulum whose length is $0.7\ m$ (*Answer: $1.68\ s$*)
- Find the length of a simple pendulum whose period is $2.3\ s$ (*Answer: $1.31\ m$*)

What do you think will happen if there are resistive forces such as air resistance acting on the simple pendulum?
