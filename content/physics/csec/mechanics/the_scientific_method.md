# 1.8 The Scientific Method
Galileo Galilei is attributed as the father of modern science. The video in the link below details his life and contributions.

Galileo's methodology involved three (3) steps:
1. **Intuition** - observing a certain phenomenon in the natural world and identifying the parts which can be translated into mathematical form
2. **Demonstration** - deductive demonstration by pure mathematics; must be true of similar instances of the phenomenon
3. **Experimentation** - verifying these deductions via experiments

Our modern scientific methodology usually employs the following steps:
1. Observe natural phenomena
2. Formulate an hypothesis to explain the phenomena
3. Use the hypothesis to predict effects
4. Perform experiments to test if the predicted effects happen

## Variables
**Variables** are ==properties== that can change in value (they can *vary*) for example:
- temperature of a gas
- time taken to eat a serving of fries
- volume of a ball

**Constants**, on other hand, cannot change in value.

>Physical quantities can serve as variables in our experiments.

### Types of variables
There are three (3) types of variables:
1. **Independent/Manipulated variables** are variables whose values we choose to ==change/manipulate==
2. **Dependent/Responding variables** are variables whose values change ==as a result of/in response to== us changing the value of the manipulated variable
3. **Controlled variables** are variables whose values we choose to keep fixed. These are **NOT** constants. They are still variables because their value ==can be changed== but we ==choose not to change them==. This is because they may affect the value of the other variables (manipulated and responding)

#### Example 1: Using different liquids to water a plant
Plan and design an experiment to see which of three liquids (water, orange juice and soda) will make a plant grow fastest.
1. Manipulated variable: The type of liquid used to water the plants (water vs. orange juice vs. soda)
2. Responding variable: The growth rate of the plant OR the surface area of the leaves OR the the length of the stem
3. Controlled variable(s): amount of each liquid used on the plants (e.g. 100 ml), observation period of each plant (e.g. for 1 week), starting age of the plants (e.g. 1 week-old seedlings), type of soil (e.g. clayey), the type of plant (e.g. black-eye pea)

>Notice that any of the controlled variables could have been used as a manipulated variable in another experiment

#### Example 2: The effect of the presence of light on fruit ripening
Plan and design an experiment to determine if it is better to store fruits in a dark area or a lit area to speed up ripening.
1. Manipulated variable: the amount of light the fruits are exposed to (0 hours of sunlight vs. 3 hours of sunlight daily) OR the location of storage (lit area vs. dark area)
2. Responding variable: the rate of ripening OR the time taken to become a certain colour
3. Controlled variable(s): temperature at which the fruits are stored, humidity of the environment, shelf-life of the fruit, interval at which the ripening is checked

#### Example 3: The effect of the frequency of drinking water on the happiness level of children
Plan and design an experiment to determine if a higher frequency of drinking water makes children happier.
1. Manipulated variable: how often we give water to the children (the frequency of drinking)
2. Responding variable: the happiness level of the children
3. Controlled variable(s): amount of water given each time (e.g. 1 cup), the type of water given (e.g. spring water), temperature of water (e.g. room temperature), the age range of the children (e.g. 9-10 year olds), the colour of the container used (e.g. clear)
