# The Equations of Motion
There are five (5) constant-acceleration equations of motion.
We use the term *constant-acceleration* because by using them, we assume that
the object has the same acceleration throughout the observation period.
They involve the following physical quantities:
- $t$ - time
- $s$ - displacement
- $u$ - initial velocity
- $v$ - final velocity
- $a$ - acceleration

Out of these 5 variables, $t$ is the only scalar quantity. Thus the others are vectors.
The equations are:
- $v=u+at$ (no $s$)
- $s=(\frac{u+v}{2})t$ (no $a$)
- $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$ (no $v$)
- $s=vt-\frac{1}{2}at^2$ (no $u$)
- $v^2=u^2+2as$ (no $t$)

Notice how for each equation, there are 4 of the 5 variables involved.
We use these equations based on what information we are given and what information we need to find.
