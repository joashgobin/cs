# 4.5 Linear Momentum
Linear momentum is the product of a body's mass and its linear velocity:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
momentum(p)&=mass(m)\times velocity(v)\\
p&=mv
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
- The more mass the body has, the greater its momentum
- The faster the body is moving, the greater its momentum
- The SI unit is kilogram-metres per second ($kgms^{-1}$):
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
p=mv\rightarrow kg\times ms^{-1}\rightarrow kgms^{-1}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
- Velocity is a vector hence momentum is also a vector
- Because momentum is a vector, when we work momentum problems, we must use a **sign convention**

## Law of conservation of linear momentum
>*For an isolated system*, the **total momentum** of the system **before collision** is equal to the **total momentum** of the system **after collision**.

For the collision between two bodies with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
total\ momentum\ before&=total\ momentum\ after\\
m_1v_1+m_2v_2&=m_1v_3+m_2v_4
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
#### Example 1
A stationary ball B mass $5\ kg$ is struck by another ball A of mass $2\ kg$ moving at $4\ ms^{-1}$. Find the final velocity of B if Ball A continues in the same direction as ball B but with velocity $1\ ms^{-1}$.

#### Example 2
Find the final velocity of B if Ball A is brought to rest by the collision.

#### Example 3
Find the final velocity of B if Ball A rebounds in the opposite direction with a velocity of $2\ ms^{-1}$.

#### Example 4
Ball C with mass $4\ kg$ moving left at $5\ ms^{-1}$ collides with ball D mass $2\ kg$ moving right at $8\ ms^{-1}$. What is the final velocity of C if D rebounds left with velocity $4\ ms^{-1}$?

#### Example 5
A bullet of mass $20\ g$ is fired from a gun with a muzzleÂ velocity of $100\ ms^{-1}$. The mass of the gun is $5\ kg$. Find the recoil velocity of the gun.
