# 6.2 Archimedes' Principle
When a body is partially or wholly submerged in a fluid, it experiences an upthrust equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.

## The relationship between Archimedes' principle and relative density
Relative density (sometimes referred to as specific gravity) is the **ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water**. It is a dimensionless quantity (has no units).
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
relative\ density(\rho_{rel})=\frac{\rho_{substance}}{\rho_{water}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
If we let the volume of the substance and that of the water be $V$:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\rho_{rel}=\frac{\rho_{substance}V}{\rho_{water}V}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
Mass is the product of density and volume thus:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\rho_{rel}=\frac{m_{substance}}{m_{water}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
Since the weight of anything is the product of its mass and acceleration due to gravity ($g$):
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\rho_{rel}&=\frac{m_{substance}g}{m_{water}g}\\
&=\frac{W_{substance}}{W_{water}}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
According to Archimedes' Principle, the weight of the water (the fluid being displaced) is equal to the upthrust:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{gathered}
\rho_{rel}=\frac{W_{substance}}{upthrust}
\end{gathered}\end{equation}$$
The upthrust is the difference between the substance's weight in air and its weight in water:
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\rho_{rel}&=\frac{W_{subs(in\ air)}}{W_{subs(in\ air)}-W_{subs(in\ water)}}\\
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
$$\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
&=\frac{weight}{apparent\ loss\ in\ weight}
\end{aligned}\end{equation}$$
#### Example
The weight of a rock in air is 200 N and its weight in water is 80 N. What is the relative density of the rock?
$$\rho_{rel}=\frac{weight\ in\ air}{weight\ in\ air-weight\ in\ water}$$
$$=\frac{200\ N}{200\ N-80\ N}$$
$$=\frac{200\ N}{120\ N}$$
$$=1.67$$
This means that the rock is 1.67 times as dense as water. Since the relative density of the rock is 1.67 (**greater than 1**), it will sink in water.

### Relative density and buoyancy
Buoyancy can be defined as the tendency of an object to float in a given fluid. We can use the relative density of a substance to predict its buoyancy:
- When a substance has a **relative density of less than 1**, ==it will float== in the fluid (liquid or gas). In other words, if a *substance is less dense than the fluid* we place it in, it will float.
- When a substance has a **relative density of more than 1**, ==it will sink== in the fluid. In other words, if a *substance is denser than the fluid* we place it in, it will sink.

#### Challenge
Study the table below and state which substances will float and those that will sink in water.

#### Challenge
Examine the table above and list which substance will float in any fluid. 
>Relative densities can be used for comparing densities of substances
