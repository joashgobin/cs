# 1.3 Measurements
Measurements are essential to our understanding of the physical world. Measuring the value of a variable as the values of other variables change is a central aspect of science.

## Standardized measurements
What if a meter meant different distances for different regions of the world? Would the world record for longest or highest jump or javelin throw be fairly determined?

### Why we need standardized measurements
Without standardized measurements, describing physical quantities to someone else would be difficult - try telling your friend how many hand-spans your seat is and have them draw a line that is the same number of hand-spans but using their hand. You will not have the same measurement unless your hands are identical in length.

Standardized measurements provide a system in which all measurements are **consistent** and **objective**:
- **Consistent** - a kilogram will always be a kilogram because its value is based on the property (mass) of a substance under a set of fixed conditions
- **Objective** - the value is not affected by opinion

### Areas which benefit from standardized measurements
Think about how the following areas would be affected if we did not have standardized measurements:
- Science
- Business
- Sports
- Any other field where information **exchange** and **integrity** are crucial

## The International System of Units/Systeme international d'unites (SI)
- The international system of units was established in 1960 and adapted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) and has been accepted by most countries worldwide
- It describes **seven (7) fundamental quantities** with their **units**

### How measurements are reported
We write measurements as the **product of** a magnitude (**how many**) and a unit (**of what**):
$$\begin{gathered}
measurement\rightarrow magnitude\times unit\\e.g.\\3\ kg\rightarrow 3\times kg
\end{gathered}$$
#### Dimensionless quantities
Some quantities **do not have units**. These are exceptions to the rule above. These include:
- Relative density
- Refractive index
- Mechanical advantage
- Velocity ratio

For example, we can study mechanical advantage (MA):
$$\begin{aligned}
MA&=\frac{load}{effort}\rightarrow \frac{N}{N}\rightarrow no\ units (dimensionless)\\
relative\ density&=\frac{density\ of\ substance}{density\ of\ water}\rightarrow \frac{kgm^{-3}}{kgm^{-3}}\rightarrow no\ units\\
refractive\ index&=\frac{sin(\hat i)}{sin(\hat r)}\rightarrow \frac{no\ units}{no\ units}\rightarrow no\ units
\end{aligned}$$
