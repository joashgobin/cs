# Logarithms
The log of a number is the **power** to which the base must raised in order to produce that number.

Given the *exponential form*:
$$a^x=b$$
$a$ is the base, $x$ is the exponent and $b$ is the given number. We can rewrite this in *log form*:
$$log_{a}b=x$$
We read this as **log base a of b is x**. Notice how $x$ is the power in the exponential form. *$x$ is the log* (the log is the power).

We know that $3^2=9$ therefore in log form this will be
$$log_{3}9=2$$
3 is the base, 9 is the given number and 2 is the power (therefore log base 3 of 9 is 2 because the log is the power and 2 is the power).

## Laws of logs
There are three (3) basic laws of logs.

### The sum of two logs
$log_{a}b+log_{a}c=log_{a}bc$

### The difference of two logs
$log_{a}b-log_{a}c=log_{a}\frac{b}{c}$

### The scalar multiple of a log
nlog_{a}b$=$log_{a}b^n
