# Getting Started with Calculus
Calculus uses quite a few of the skills and concepts learnt from Algebra. It is 
recommended that you know how to transpose and factorize comfortably. Knowing about polynomial, rational, exponential 
and logarithmic functions is also useful.

In order to become better at Mathematics, we need to care about the language used. 
New students often take the terminology for granted and this cripples them 
in the long run. For example, the fancy phrase *derivative of the product of two trigonometrical functions* sounds 
intimidating at first but with a little extra care we can easily learn to write 
it into mathematical notation:
$$\frac{d}{dx}(\sin{x}\cos{x})$$

$\sin{x}$ is a *trig function* and $\cos{x}$ is a *trig function* and thus multiplying 
them gives us the *product of two trigonometrical functions*. We will learn that 
the derivative is essentially the gradient/slope of a graph thus our fancy phrase 
simply means the *slope of the graph of this product ($\sin{x}\cos{x}$)*.

It is a lack of care for the language that is the dividing line between Mathematics 
being a rewarding experience or an absolute nightmare. This is especially evident 
for Calculus.
