# Styles of APIs
Erik Wilde has a video (!video{{}}) in which he mentions five (5) styles of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs):
- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) (aka Tunnel)
- Resource
- Hypermedia
- Query
- Event-based

## Remote procedure call APIs
An example of this is the Godot Game Engine's Multiplayer API. The host and clients can
make remote procedure calls to specific functions defined by the developer.

## Resource APIs


## Hypermedia APIs


## Query APIs


## Event-based APIs
