# Symptoms and Causes of Complexity
This article is based on John Ousterhout's lessons on software design, specifically his book "A Philosophy 
of Software Design". He speaks on what can cause a system to be complex and what ways complexity can manifest itself.
A software system doesn't have to be large in order to be complex. It is very much possible to
write a very confusing 100 lines of code. It is also possible to have a code base with 1000's of lines that
are easy to pick up and manage.

## Causes
There are two (2) causes of complexity in a system:
- dependencies
- obscurities

## Symptoms
There are three (3) ways to identify a system that is complex:
- change amplification
- cognitive load
- unknown unknowns

Being mindful of how we manage and remedy complexity in our software systems is an 
essential skill if we are to have them last for years and treated with care by those who
will work on them in future.
