# The Significance of Christmas
This isn't an article to promote superficial symbols adopted by mainstream media 
and pushed by capitalists to exploit the emotions of those who lack specific luxuries or even common material 
goods. This is not about "Christmas spirit" or "holiday cheer" but rather more 
fulfilling concepts.

Christmas is significant because it is how we remember the birth of our Lord, Jesus 
Christ. It represents a radical idea tied to the Gospel itself. Here is the notion that 
God would lower Himself to the state of a humble servant and dwell among us. The Creator, instead of being 
completely disgusted by His creation and turning His back on us, has decided to enter 
into that creation so that He may redeem some. Christ became a curse for our sake:

!bible{{Galatians 3:13}}

He paid the greatest of prices, serving as the propitiation for our sins (*penal substitutionary atonement*), and He gives us salvation as a free gift:

!bible{{Ephesians 2:8-9}}

When all of the other major world religions and even certain cults that masquerade 
as Christian tell us we have to do something in order to be saved, Christ appears, pays the bill in full and ends our personal war against God:

!bible{{2 Corinthians 5:21}}

Through Christ we have been made righteous so for this Christmas season, take it easy with 
the shopping list and the payslip. We have a much greater reason to rejoice, one 
that doesn't require your checkbook or even a birth certificate.
