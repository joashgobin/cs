# The Current Context of Innovation and Change
Companies that have innovation management outperform their competitors in social benefits, growth, financial performance and job creation.

## Innovation management
We need to actively attempt to manage innovation - it is not automatic or easily done. Innovation management is different from standard management because of the constant changes in the body of knowledge required to do it successfully - this constant change also makes the academic dissection of innovation difficult.

## The global definition of innovation
The OECD's Oslo Manual defines innovation as *the implementation of a new or significantly improved product, process, marketing method or new organizational method put into practice in the company*.

It is more creativity and entrepreneurship.

## The difference between creativity and innovation
Creativity can be defined as "a new, appropriate, useful, correct or valuable response to the task that is heuristic rather than algorithmic". The creative process involves people, tasks and organizations.

Innovation can be defined as "the generation, acceptance and implementation of new ideas, processes, products or services".

Innovative people are normally creative but not vice versa. Creativity is about the generation of new ideas but innovation is about the successful application of those ideas from the basic research stage up until the market penetration stage.

## Types and classes of innovation
The 2018 Oslo Manual defines four(4) types of innovation:
- product innovation
- process innovation
- commercial innovation (new marketing methods)
- organizational innovation (new organizational methods)

The classes of innovation are:
- incremental innovation - adds value to an existing product, process, etc.
- adjacent innovation - adapting current products, processes, etc. to other markets or fields
- disruptive innovation - rethinking/reinventing a product, process, etc.
