# Streamlining and Acceleration

Accelerators also provide networking opportunities consisting of different events designed to connect startups and investors.

## Background to corporate acceleration
Corporate accelerators are a good opportunity for companies in their business and commercial exercise to participate in promising innovations from startups around the world.

>A startup is a growth-oriented business that seeks a repeatable and scalable business model, which is based on innovative products or services in an uncertain and unstable environment.

There is an innovation gap between traditional and newer companies that must be filled by the older companies in order for them to thrive.

## Agile corporate acceleration vs. traditional business acceleration
Newly created companies entering corporate acceleration programs have and develop minimum viable products (MVPs). The goal of these participating entrepreneurs is to achieve milestones such as launching a new product, acquiring a major client, receiving financing, or taking the education and counseling offered.

Corporate accelerators are special organizational forms for creating an open innovation process from the outside in - they are limited-time programs that startups can apply for if their product fits into a certain category.

## Digital businesses are either agile or "will vanish"
One of the main driving forces for digital technologies is the capacity of innovation and customization of information technology.
