## Planning
In any project, we first engage in start-up and planning. Before planning, we identify the stakeholders (some being already involved in the planning), create the project vision and project letter.

We identify necessary suppliers and technical profiles (the types of people with specific professional experience). The start of the project ends with the "kick-off" meeting/event, after which we begin the work schedule, including time for planning. This meeting entails introduction of work team and project manager to the most important stakeholders of the project, including the project sponsor.

## The goal of planning
Planning serves to help us effectively achieve the goals/objectives of the project - it is not a goal in itself but rather a tool for us to maximize the value we create and the reduce the risks we undertake in the project. People are more important than planning and have good planning doesn't guarantee the success of the project.

## The product of the planning process
Planning is a "baseline" approved by and known to stakeholders and it results in clarity about what to do and what the next steps are. As changes are approved and consolidated, we get a new baseline (the plan changes).

## The appropriate level of detail
The level of detail of planning is dependent on the duration of the project. We do not plan a year of work in 3 days but we can plan today's work in a few minutes.

## Traditional planning
This involves planning the entire project at the beginning. The common steps are:
- Define the activities
- Sequence the activities
- Estimate the resources
- Estimate the duration of the activities
- Develop the schedule:
    - do a risk analysis
    - determine risk management activities
    - determine the risk costs
    - determine the activity costs
    - determine the project budget
    - develop the project calendar or schedule

From planning, we also get a project budget and schedule. We can also have a register of detected risks and mitigation or avoidance measures planned for the project.
