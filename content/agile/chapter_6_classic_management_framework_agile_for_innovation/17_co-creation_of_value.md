# Co-creation of Value
Co-creation is more about solving needs that influence competitive environments through active dialogue than it is about pleasing customers. We use the DART (Dialogue, Access, Risk Reduction, Transparency) framework:
- knowledge is shared between stakeholders in dialogue
- access directs the organization to exchange information about the value and thus create positive experiences
- in risk assessment, greater information and responsibility is required for value creators in managing the risks of co-created assets
- transparency is an essential building block due to the establishment of trust necessary for interaction between organizations and customers

## Co-innovation
This can be seen as the collective actions of actors to develop ideas and create knowledge. It is the collective process of creation and dissemination of knowledge, as well as the development and evaluation of creative ideas between different actors to obtain Co-innovations in organizations.

Co-innovation comprises of:
- the value creation area of new business models
- the value creation area to increase the customer base
- the value creation area for better performance
- the value creation area of new products, services or undertakings
- the value creation area seeking to reinvent the concept of customer value

The environment in which co-innovation takes place is defined as a virtual innovation platform. This virtual environment essentially fulfills the following 3 roles:
- facilitate collaboration in 3 of the internal and external actors and thus obtain innovations
- motivate action
- satisfy the needs of stakeholders
