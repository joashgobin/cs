# Agile Approach to Co-creation of Value
The traditional company-centric strategy is no longer working - new customer-centric ways of creating value are necessary.

## The dynamics of co-creation of value
It is better for companies to ask what they can do for the customer rather than where they are going. The DART model relates dialogue, access, risk assessment and transparency with aim to make the flow of information between customer and company more symmetric to foster the co-creation of value. Co-creation of value is important to facilitate the formulation of the innovation strategy.

We must not overlook research on the 4 key areas in DART.

## Dimensions of co-creation of value
The DART model aligns well with agile practices and Lean methodology - there is collaboration between companies and customers, transparency and communication, prioritization based on business value, and continuous learning:
- Dialogue - companies need to have active engagement and dialogue with customers - we do not pamper the customer but collaborate with them to maximize the delivery of business value to them
- Access - customers can gain value by means other than owning a product. They can gain value from accessing knowledge, tools and professionalism
- Risk assessment - customers should be informed about the risks introduced and avoided by using the company's products, services, etc.
- Transparency - the interaction processes between the company and stakeholders must be transparent in order to generate trust. Remember that customer insights are important in value creation and trust must be built in order for customers to not feel closed off to the company - companies should demystify their key processes in order to get this trust

## Advantages of co-creation
Co-creation allows companies to engage customers on a whole new level, even to the point where customers actively market the brand without expecting compensation. New markets, market stakeholders, higher customer satisfaction and long-term retention are just a few benefits awaiting companies that are willing to adapt.

## Co-creation in today's changing context
Companies that want to stand out must adapt to this new paradigm. Traditional marketing and customer engagement practices fall short in this high information age - customers are looking for meaning, not off-the-shell advertisements and false promises.
