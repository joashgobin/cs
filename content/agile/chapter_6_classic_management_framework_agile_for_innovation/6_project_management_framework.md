# Project Management Framework
In project management, we consider all the possible dimensions: risks, costs, time, scope, communication with stakeholders and quality. The project manager serves to observe, size and take care of compliance with the project requirements in these all dimensions.

## The 10 areas of project management
These areas include but are not limited to the triple constraints. They are:
- scope
- timing
- cost
- quality
- human resources
- communications
- risks
- purchasing/suppliers
- stakeholders
