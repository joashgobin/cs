# Scope of the Project
The scope is the expected result of the project - how much we expect to accomplish at a certain point in time. We translate the scope into requirements - the larger the scope, the more requirements we expect to fulfill.

In scope management, we need to define the work - define the requirements relevant to the business case of the project.

As good practice:
- all stakeholders must be discussed
- take product and project requirements
- the requirements do not only speak of product scope but also of quality, technical requirements, legal requirements, communication requirements, etc.
- they must be documented, uniquely identified
- a requirement traceability matrix with its status must be created and maintained

The work breakdown structure (WBS) must contain all the work in terms of the tasks and groups of tasks. We determine requirements iteratively.

## How to make a good WBS
The WBS must be broken to a level that allows control of work packages.

## Scope baseline
We use a scope baseline for verification and control of the scope. The scope baseline is comprised of:
- scope statement
- WBS
- WBS dictionary

The scope baseline consists of maintaining scheduled and frequent meetings - this helps us to avoid "surprises" as we keep the client informed of the progress and get their feedback to make any necessary changes.
