# Project Control
In order to control a project,we we must know how every task is doing at all times. If the progress of a task cannot be determined then the task might be too big.

Planning requires control as well.

## The earned value methodology
This is essential to analyze and report the progress of the project. It can be summarized:
- consider the concepts of "Done" and "Incurred"
- we have the planned "Done" and "Incurred" for a certain date
- we also have the planned "Incurred" and actual "Incurred" for that certain date
- each of these concepts are measured in monetary units
- if the planned "Done" is less than the actual "Done", we are progressing less than expected
- if the actual "Incurred" is higher than the planned "Incurred", we are consuming more cost than we should
- a project can be going well in terms of time but badly in terms of costs
- we may have to speed up the work save costs where required

## Project configuration management
The tool we use for project control is Configuration Management System. It provides us a way to keep track of each element registered at every point in time - the status of each document, each team member, the interested parties, etc.

The system's information serves as a snapshot for the state of the project. The system consists of a set of tools that the project manager uses to manage and control the project.
