# Project Control
In order to control a project,we we must know how every task is doing at all times. If the progress of a task cannot be determined then the task might be too big.

Planning requires control as well.

## The earned value methodology
This is essential to analyze and report the progress of the project. It can be summarized:
- consider the concepts of "Done" and "Incurred"
- we have the planned "Done" and "Incurred" for a certain date
- we also have the planned "Incurred" and actual "Incurred" for that certain date
- each of these concepts are measured in monetary units
- if the planned "Done" is less than the actual "Done", we are progressing less than expected
- if the actual "Incurred" is higher than the planned "Incurred", we are consuming more cost than we should
- a project can be going well in terms of time but badly in terms of costs
- we may have to speed up the work save costs where required

## Project configuration management
The tool we use for project control is Configuration Management System. It provides us a way to keep track of each element registered at every point in time - the status of each document, each team member, the interested parties, etc.

The system's information serves as a snapshot for the state of the project. The system consists of a set of tools that the project manager uses to manage and control the project.

## Quality management
Quality is the degree to which the project meets the requirements. Quality management have 3 distinct steps:
- plan quality
- quality assurance - performs audits to see there is any indication that standards, policies, plans or procedures are not being followed; seeks best practices and improves processes
- quality control - measures the performance of the project in terms of meeting the requirements

## Cost of Quality (COQ)
This is about evaluating the cost of compliance (and by extension, non-compliance) with quality. We do not try to enforce perfect quality as this may lead to wastage. Instead, we focus on sufficient fulfillment of requirements ("good enough" quality).

Control Diagrams are used to represent quality measurements. We show both the lower and upper limits of control and see if the process average stays in between these limits.
