# Project Life Cycle
Traditional projects have startup, planning, execution, control and closure stages.

## Kicking off the project
This entails the project charter, initiation of work team and introduction to stakeholders. Stakeholders are made aware that they will be required to approve the project milestones.

## Project planning
The Project Management Plan is created - a set of plans including purchasing plans, human resource plans, task plan, risk management plan, etc.

More plans include training plans, continuous improvement plans, test plans (in software projects), integration plans, etc. We create a work breakdown structure (WBS) which consists of "work packages" (groups of tasks), focused on creating deliverables.

The project has 3 baselines:
- scope baseline
- time baseline
- cost baseline

## Project execution
Quality assurance is pivotal as we work to accomplish the project deliverables and milestones. The project manager serves at this stage as a distributor of information.

Coordination with suppliers and issuing of contracts with third parties also happen at this stage.
