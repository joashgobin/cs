# Project Launch
When starting a project, we identify stakeholders, make preparations, define roles and start-up of the work. The kick-off of the project involves selection and assignment of the project manager - this person will seek to gain an understanding of the reason (business case) for the project and then aids in the early decision-making.

For large projects, the management and planning activities can be divided up and done in parallel.

## Project objectives
The customer has their objectives. These need to be modified in order to better reflect realistic outcomes. The project objectives take into account both the customer's needs and/or desires but also the constraints (time, budget, etc.) within which the work team is operating.

If a customer's requirement do not align with our constraints then the professional action to take would be to inform the customer of the restrictions and possible alternatives or costs incurred in the case of us moving forward with the difficult requirement. If no compromise is found then the project can no longer be undertaken.

A project may be successful in a way that is different from what is originally intended. In such a case, the Business Case needs changing.

## Project structure
A framework gives us a set of ideas, good practices, techniques and tips but it does not tell us which ones to use in a specific situation and in what order. A methodology, on the other hand, does tell us what to do and in what order - it is a set of ordered practices that must be followed rigorously. The phases (the project structure) are determined by the methodology.

## Project environment
The environment affects our work and is comprised of:
- the business strategy
- the "project program" - the set of projects that when conducted alongside each other provide more value as a whole compared to if they were separate
- the Project Management Office (POM) - the systems put in place within the organization that facilitate project management

## The attitude of the project manager
Project managers have to be proactive rather than reactive. Managers need to also understand which stakeholders are more important to a project and focus on them instead of trying to please stakeholders that have little say as to the project's success.

PMs need to be able to organize their own work and manage their own time very well before they can effectively help the work team to improve in efficiency.
