# Dimensions, Critical Factors and Innovation Models
The first 5 dimensions of innovation are focused on process:
1. Focus on the identification of levels of research and intervention which arise individually, go through the groups and reach the organization considering the form of innovation
2. Recognize the management of innovation resources, identifying market opportunities
3. value strategic direction from the bottom up and vice versa
4. Incorporate various sources of invention and adoption
5. Establish control over the value network

The other 5 dimensions are focused on the result:
6. Choose the nature of the innovation tacitly or explicitly
7. Define the way to innovate, whether in product, service, process or business model
8. Determine the magnitude of the innovation in incremental or radical terms
9. Structure a learning reference, which can be the company, the market or the industry
10. Determine the type of innovation, in administrative or technical processes to face the critical factors of the environment

## Critical factors
The 4 critical innovation factors are:
- strategy
- structure
- systems
- environment

## Models of innovation
There are 6 generations of innovation management models:
- the technological offer model - focuses on research and development (R&D) proposals and presents the market as the recipient of the results of R&D
- the market demand model - market needs serve as a guide for R&D which reacts to changes in the market
- the coupling models - show a balance between R&D and the market; feedback in involved in between
- the integrated models - integrate work teams and shows strong links between offers and partnerships with other companies. It emphasizes the integration of R&D and manufacturing
- the network models - show total integration with internal and external networks
- the innovative environment model - shows the influence of multiple environments, high levels of uncertainty, market structure, public policies, formal institutional framework and competitive pressures creating a limited environment which generates new opportunities for innovation - this is the model that requires an agile culture in companies

## Competitive innovation can only be agile
Innovation is fundamental to many organizations in their pursuit to be competitive, sustainable and enduring in the market and global environment. Innovation introduces risk of failure and it is the organizations that are successful in the innovation activity that end up surviving - it is not that these companies have not failed to innovate at times but they have managed risks properly and minimized losses enough to not go bankrupt or fall into obscurity.

Some causes of failure in corporate innovation are:
- an incomplete, poorly defined and/or misaligned strategy
- no adapting the company's culture to a culture that favours growth and innovation where the central axis will be change or transformation
- inadequate leadership throughout the organization
- the wrong tools and processes
- lack of integration or assimilation of the innovation activity in the main business
