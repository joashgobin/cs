# Creation and Capture of Value
Value creation is the agile measure of productivity and performance of a team of people, a project, a department, a process or a company.

## Mechanisms to create and capture value
Innovation can create and capture value but the exact way in which this happens is not well documented. Some key mechanisms that contribute to how innovation creates and delivers value are:
- a novelty in the offer of products or services
- a novelty in the process
- complexity (achieve technical excellence)
- legal protection of intellectual property
- add or expand the range of competitive factors
- synchronization
- a quick advantage for followers/successive products or services
- robust design/platform
- rewriting the rules
- reconfiguring the parts of the process
- transfer to different application contexts

## Trend in innovation leadership
Agile leadership (collaborate and communicate) is different from traditional leadership (command and control). Innovation leaders recognize and manage critical success factors (CSFs) to create valuable advantages from innovation including higher returns to stakeholders, more customer loyalty, greater partnership preferences and greater retention and attraction of talent. Agile leadership is innovative leadership - facilitating learning, listening, better work, etc.
