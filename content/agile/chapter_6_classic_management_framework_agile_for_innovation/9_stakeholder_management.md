# Stakeholder Management
We need to first identify the impacted parties - stakeholders do not have to be interested in the project in order to be affected (positively or negatively) by its outcomes.

The most relevant stakeholders of a project are:
- the sponsor(s)
- the project manager(s)
- the project team
- the community of users or recipients of the product
- support groups

## A useful classification of stakeholders
The basic work-tool we use for stakeholder management is the PC Matrix (Power-Commitment Matrix). On the x axis is the interest level and on the y axis is the power. The matrix has four categories:
- stakeholders with a lot of power and interest (promoters) - we manage them closely
- stakeholders with a lot of power but little interest (latents) - we inform them of the successes of the project in order to help them appreciate the value of the project
- stakeholders with little power but a lot of interest (defenders) - we do not dedicate a lot of effort to them but we keep them informed
- stakeholders with little power and little interest (apathetics) - we do not put much effort into these but we can monitor them over time

## Work with stakeholders
In working with stakeholders, we need to:
- consider their need and define the product
- manage change while asking if the change is helpful to the stakeholders

## Work with suppliers
Suppliers are a special group of stakeholders distinguished by the signing of legally binding contracts. The types of suppliers are:
- strategic suppliers - we are completely dependent on these thus we need to maintain good long-term relationships e.g. the engine manufacturer for a vehicle company (if the engine changes then we have to redesign the car)
- tactical suppliers - these are essential for implementing good tactical decisions to enter a new market or launch a new product - changing these will not affect the design of our product but it can affect our schedule, costs, etc.
- operational suppliers - changing these has no impact on costs, etc. - these supplier are interchangeable
- commodities - we need these suppliers but they are interchangeable

We define "Done" for suppliers as:
- what you expect
- in what terms
- at what level of quality, detail and performance
- at what price
- penalties in case of non-compliance
- additional requirements to those of the product: communication requirements, monitoring, security, compliance with different regulations, etc.
