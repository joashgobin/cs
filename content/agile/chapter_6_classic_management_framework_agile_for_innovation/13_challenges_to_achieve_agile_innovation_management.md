# Challenges to Achieve Agile Innovation Management
Innovation management must be a holistic system that has a series of processes - this includes the work done to innovate and also the business strategies involved. A partial approach to innovation management is as good as no approach at all.

## Elements that make up the innovation system
Companies that innovate successfully see higher ROI, better access to capital, higher brand value, better suppliers, allies and distributors and more motivated personnel joining the company because of the work environment and benefits that come from having an innovative focus.

The innovation system (the holistic innovation model) is comprised of:
- people
- company
- innovation process
- environment

## Open innovation
This concept emphasizes that companies must acquire valuable resources from external companies and share internal resources for the development of new products and/or services.
Some of the principles of open innovation are:
- new knowledge is generated inside and outside the company
- new developments are based on internal research or the absorption of the results of external research
- investigations that do not find an outlet within the company itself are licensed to other companies
- the most important thing is to capture value from innovation
