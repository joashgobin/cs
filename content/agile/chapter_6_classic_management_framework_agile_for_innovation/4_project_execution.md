# Project Execution
Project execution and control management work consist of managing risks, monitoring tasks and intermediate milestones, cost consumption, taking corrective measures, efficiently managing changes that arise and maintaining the management team work focused on results.

## Project execution management
Planning is not limited to the beginning of the project. Planning should be seen as the continual modification of the project in response to new changes and constraints that appear. We do not "launch" work, we do it and monitor the outcomes.

As risks arise, we identify them and make decisions and justify these decisions. We can use Cause Effect Diagrams (a.k.a. fish bone or Ishikawa diagrams) to visualize and organize the steps to or causes of realization of risks and defects. We aim to formalize the mindset to get to the root cause of the defect and be able to look back and identify what factors contributed to it.

## Change management
Project managers are change managers. PMs:
- identify the cause and origin of the change
- identify the change
- assess the impact
- evaluate the change - is it beneficial or detrimental to the project?
- detail the options to approve or reject the change
- approve of the change or reject it
- if rejected, the change request is logged and finalized
- if approved, updates are included in all the project documents (schedule, cost plan, requirements, scope detail, etc.)
- communicate this approval and new version of project documents to the appropriate stakeholders

Sources of change can be the work team, the client, user requests, the environment outside the organization, etc.

A Change Control System includes standardized forms, reports, processes, procedures and programs to track and control changes.

## Work team management
Good PMs inspire and support and give the work team the right to:
- have good and bad days
- need for time to learn
- make a mistake
- speak, share their opinions, participate in decisions and understand why things are done (or not done)
- know what the image of the project or service is for the client or the company
- make sure they are heard

In conflicts, we do not encourage there to be a winner and a loser. We resolve the issues collaboratively by having the parties involve come to a compromise or a better understanding.
