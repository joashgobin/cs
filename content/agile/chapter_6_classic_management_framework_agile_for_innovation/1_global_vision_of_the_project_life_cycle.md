# Global Vision of the Project Life Cycle
A project is an investment of resources (people, time, money and materials). These different factors make every project unique - no two projects have the exact same budget, team, costs, working conditions, etc.

The *triple constraint* (time, cost and scope) for each project is different even for agile projects where the cost and time are fixed and the scope is less certain. We manage services differently compared to projects - a project has milestones and releases whereas services do not.

## Global vision by stages
