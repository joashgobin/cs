# Corporate Accelerators
The adoption of corporate accelerators to link newly created companies is gaining momentum among corporations around the world.

## Corporate acceleration process
Corporate accelerators provide development programs for promising high-tech companies that can develop their products and services, mainly in the early stages, offering mentors, networks, management services, knowledge, experience, services, stakeholder access resources, and office spaces.

Y Combinator was the first corporate accelerator, used as the global benchmark for corporate accelerators.

Corporate accelerators are set up for short periods, usually 3 months, compared to incubators, which generally last between 1 and 5 years. Accelerators being short is a testament to the agile nature of the activities therein.

The shorter times also encourage rapid growth or failure of startups - it is essentially trial by fire. A corporate accelerator selects a cohort of application startups to participate in the acceleration program.

There are 2 models of corporate acceleration:
- Generic acceleration programs - are aimed at many types of startups
- Specific acceleration programs - are focused on a particular industry or technology.

## Corporate acceleration model
Corporations have 3 options:
- Operate the program in-house
- Outsource its management to a partner that markets the program, reviews, selects newly created companies to link to in each cohort, provides mentors, manages the program
- Sponsor the program as a part of a group of sponsors

## Benefits of agile corporations
Agile corporations accelerate thanks to:
- understanding emerging technologies and trends
- rapid, cost-efficient R&D (research and development)
- economic returns
- talent flow
- industry-focused experts
- corporate resources
- future customers
