# Closing on the Principles
We must think holistically because services, processes, practices, departments, etc. do not operate in isolation. Every entity can potential affect the others so we need to manage these things together - we analyze and plan for the whole rather than just parts.

## Keep it simple and practical
Do not overcomplicate a process. Take the minimum number of steps and do them efficiently - there is no merit to be gained in doing everything using the hardest route.

If a process does not add value, simply do not allocate company resources to doing it.


## Optimize and automate
Every resource we use must accomplish maximum value otherwise it is wasteful. We automate in order to free up resources, usually personnel, to be used more effectively elsewhere. Automations can be put in place when we have found an optimal use for a resource or process.
