# Service Value Chain
The centerpiece of the service value system is the value chain which outlines the main activities that are involved in the creation of value as we manage products and services. The value chain has six (6) activities:
- planning
- improvement
- engagement
- design and transition
- obtaining/building
- delivery and support

These activities are interconnected, each transforming inputs into outputs and having their own set of service management practices. The universal rules which apply to these practices are:
- incoming and outgoing interactions with parties outside the chain are done through the *engage* activity
- resources are obtained through the *obtain/build* activity
- improvements are done at the *improve activity*

A service value stream is a subset of the overall value chain designed to cater for a specific scenario in the company's business activities.

## Value chain vs. process
The value chain is a set of activities. We execute multiple processes within the value chain. It is also possible to refer to the value chain as a process itself as it accepts inputs and produces outputs.

A value stream consists of multiple processes because the value chain is itself a set of processes.
