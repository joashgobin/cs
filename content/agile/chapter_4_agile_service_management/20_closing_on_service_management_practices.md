# Closing on Service Management Practices
The goal of supplier management is to ensure that suppliers and their actions are adequately managed to support the continuous supply of quality products and services. We collaborate and foster closer relationships with key vendors to create more value and reduce risks.

The key activities are:
- creation of a single point of visibility and control to ensure consistency
- maintenance of a supplier strategy, policy and contract management information
- negotiation and agreement on contracts
- relationships management and contracts with internal and external suppliers
- supplier performance management

### Sourcing, supplier strategy and relationships
A supplier management strategy defines the organization's plans for how its overall service management strategy will work, taking advantage of contribution of suppliers in achieving goals.

Some types of relationships between an organization and its suppliers include:
- insourcing - development of products and services internally
- outsourcing - external suppliers provide the products and services
- single source or partnership - acquiring products and services from a supplier
- multiple suppliers

## Workforce and talent management
We need to ensure that the organization has the people with the right skills and expertise in the right roles. We focus on organizational speed, competencies, skills, capacities, knowledge and attitudes.

Some key activities of this practice include:
- workforce planning
- recruitment
- performance measurement
- personal development
- learning and development
- mentoring and rotation planning

## Business analysis
This practice serves to analyze aspects of a business and define recommended needs and recommend solutions for these needs and solve business problems in order to deliver more value.

The key activities are:
- analysis of business systems, processes and services, and identification and prioritization of parts of the value system, products and services that require improvement
- evaluation and proposal of actions that can be taken to create desired improvement
