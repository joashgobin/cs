# Service Management Practices
There must be continuous improvement. The key activities in this practice are:
- promoting continuous improvement throughout the organization
- ensuring that there is time and budget for improvement
- identification and registration of opportunities for improvement
- evaluation and prioritization of opportunities for improvement
- development of business cases for improvement action
- planning and implementation of improvements
- measurement and evaluation of improvement results
- coordination of improvement activities throughout the organization

Continuous improvement needs to done intentionally at all levels of the organization by leadership and staff in order to produce the most favourable results.

### Recording ideas and proposals for improvement
In order to objectively make decisions for continuous improvement, we need to consult with actual data. The Continual Improvement Register (CIR) can be used to track and manage ideas from individuals, teams, departments, etc.

## Knowledge management
Knowledge is power and our ability to effectively manage the knowledge within the organization directly impacts the success rates of the company. We can process data into useful information using the DIKW scheme:
- data - this is the raw data collected
- information - this is data alongside documentation that gives the data meaning in a specific context
- knowledge - this is when we have understood the information in a sufficient way to make the right decisions
- wisdom - the aggregation of making the right decisions multiple times gives us an advantage of now knowing how to handle similar situations in other contexts

## Measurement and reporting
This is where we analyze and present information to support good decision making and continuous improvement through the reduction of uncertainty. We collect information on managed objects and process this information into various metrics:
- Critical Success Factor (CSF) - a precondition necessary for the successful accomplishment of a goal or intended result
- Key Performance Indicator (KPI) - an important measure used to evaluate how successful we are in achieving a goal

We set KPIs for teams more often than individuals because focusing too much on individual-based KPIs can lead to unhealthy competition and conflicting interests in the work place.
