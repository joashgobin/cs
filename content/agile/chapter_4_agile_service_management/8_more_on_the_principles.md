# More on the Principles
The principles of agile service management work together. A company that provides value to and collaborates with its customers via regular feedback and updates needs to also work in an iterative manner.

## Focus on value
What doesn't provide to the customers, stakeholders or the company is not worth doing or offering. Value can be seen in the form of more sales, lower production costs, higher customer and employee satisfaction, better reviews,greater customer loyalty, more opportunities, reduced probability of risks, etc.

Creating value always starts with us asking for whom are we offering the service or creating the product. Then we ask what is valuable to them/what can bring value to their lives.

Customer experience (CX) is the accumulation of all the interactions a customer has with the company and its products and/or services. How long they wait for an order to how much they pay for the item or service all contribute to CX.

## Start where you are now
Do not throw away everything and start from scratch. Often we can have many tools already available to us but we fail to leverage them in a new way because we see them as bad for a new venture. The same emailing system that may have failed to sell online courses to potential customers can be repurposed and used to efficiently run an email newsletter.

Much value is unrealized and past resources and efforts go to waste when we choose to start with a blank slate. Of course, when reusing systems or tools from other projects, we should base our decision on what to keep on data instead of opinion. Risks and benefits need to be evaluated - if the emailing system would take a month and 1000 dollars to repurpose and we can create a new tool using half that time and budget, the wiser option would be to discard the old tool.
