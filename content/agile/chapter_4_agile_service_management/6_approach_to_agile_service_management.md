# Approach to Agile Service Management
*Service management* is the series of capabilities that enable a business to deliver value to its customers via services.

## Value and co-creation of value
We focus on delivering what the customer needs and/or desires and also make an effort to leave out what does not add value. We also need to deliver services that resonate with our customers - services that give them a chance to play an active role in tailoring the outcomes instead of just receiving a one-size-fit-all result. They can design the product or service around what they deem to be of most value to them. A customer signing up for an online newsletter should be able to decide if they want to opt in or out of receiving sales offers or news about coffee blends or updates about ticket prices for an upcoming music festival or news about local businesses.

## Enabling customers and partners
It is important that we manage the relationships among the people involved whether they are within our company or from a partner or supplier. We must also ensure that we enable our customers to access our services, even if it means that we have to provide or outsource a product or service. For example, training a customer to use our software makes no sense if they do not have a laptop or other device to even run that software. We either provide a way for them to acquire a device or we change the target audience.

## Protecting the business
Finally we must also consider the costs, risks and outcomes associated with providing a service to our customers. If the service is too expensive to sustain or the target audience has a personal belief that prevents them from using our service then we must consider alternatives instead of wasting time and resources on providing such services.

## How products, services and processes are related
We can use products in order to deliver a service (using a laptop to write an email for someone). Even when someone buys a phone (a product), they are really buying the services of being able to communicate with family and friends and browse the internet. We use processes to provide services and to create products - doing so exhausts the company's resources and time.
