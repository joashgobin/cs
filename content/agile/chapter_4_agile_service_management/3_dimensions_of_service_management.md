# Dimensions of Service Management
There are four (4) dimensions of service management:
- organizations and people
- information and technology
- partners and suppliers
- value flows/streams and processes

If we fail to address each of these then our service can fail or underperform. These dimensions apply to every service operating within and supplied by our company. There can also be external environmental or technological factors, current policies, constraints and socioeconomic or geopolitical factors that will affect our services and how we manage them.

## Organizations and people
We can measure the efficiency of a company by the structure of as well as the culture therein. We can train employees to work more efficiently and provide proper leadership and support structures to ensure they complete their duties in a frictionless manner. Recall that we value people over processes as part of the agile approach.

When identifying and fixing issues in a company with regards to the people involved, we use a Smart Data (data-driven) approach - where we make decisions based on data we collect, not on speculation and past experiences in other settings.
