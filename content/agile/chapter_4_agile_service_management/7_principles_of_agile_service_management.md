# Principles of Agile Service Management
- Focus on creating value - optimize what adds value and remove what does not. What is more valuable must be determined by data not opinions
- Start from where you are - leverage what already exists and is available to you instead of wasting time and resources by always starting from scratch
- Make progress iteratively, always based on feedback - test new strategies and ensure there is evidence that they work otherwise get rid of them
- Collaborate and promote visibility - accountability and transparency build trust and understanding
- Think and work holistically - services and products do not operate in isolation
- Keep it practical and simple - do not do flashy things if they expend many resources and give little benefit

## The agile approach and technology services
Agile helps technology companies improve rapidly because the work team learns faster and is able to deliver value faster. The customer also almost always has an updated version (the production release) of the software that they can use and gain value from, despite there being ongoing work. Working in an agile manner goes hand-in-hand with managing services in an agile manner.
