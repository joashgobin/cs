## The 7-step continuous improvement model
Continuous improvement can happen at all levels and can be driven by all individuals, tools and processes in the organization.

The seven(7) steps of the continuous improvement model are:
- What is the vision?
- Where are we now?
- Where do we want to be? We use KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and CSFs (Critical Success Factors) to measure what we have and we aim to change the current values to more desired values
- How do we get these?
- Take action
- Have we arrived?
- How do we keep the momentum for improvement?

## Continuous improvement and the theory of constraints
The Theory of Constraints (ToC) indicates that the weakest links in the value chain limit the performance of the entire chain. Thus we need to fix these weak points in order for the overall productivity of the organization to increase. The Lean practice of value chain mapping can be used to determine where these weak points exist.
