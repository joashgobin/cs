# Agile Management of Technological Services
ITSM means information technology service management. This form of service management needs to be agile. This is because the IT world and the services provided by IT are always evolving.

Since the release of the Agile Manifesto in 2001, many companies, even ones outside of the software development industry have adopted agile approaches to management.

Some characteristics of agile management are:
- ever-evolving collection of requirements through feedback analysis and direct observation
- division of work into small increments and iterations
- establishment of cross-functional product-based teams
- visual presentations (Kanban) and regular discussion of progress (daily stand ups)
- presentation of the results of the work done (the demo) to stakeholders at the end of each of iteration

We cannot be agile in only the management of work. In order for the organization's value chain to be constantly improving in efficiency, we must be agile in how we provide services, manage finances and resources, handle contracts, execute procurement, analyze and make use of information, etc.

## Technology and agile
As agile approaches become more prominent, technology evolves to match the ever-increasing demands of organizations (e.g. faster internet speeds, better management software, etc). As the technology improves, the ability of the organization to be agile improves. Thus agile and the technology that facilitates being agile grow alongside each other.
