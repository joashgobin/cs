# Information and Technology, Partners and Suppliers
We use information (knowledge) and technology both in the delivery and management of services. Technology includes knowledge management systems, workflow management systems, communication systems, inventories and analytical tools. We consider:
- the information managed by services
- the knowledge support needed to deliver and manage services
- the effect of the information manipulated by the service on the service itself

Some services provide value by managing the customer's information. They help the user to better visualize and organize information relevant to them while filtering out unimportant details. Other services allow for easy and secure exchange of information between users.
