# Information and Technology, Partners and Suppliers
We use information (knowledge) and technology both in the delivery and management of services. Technology includes knowledge management systems, workflow management systems, communication systems, inventories and analytical tools. We consider:
- the information managed by services
- the knowledge support needed to deliver and manage services
- the effect of the information manipulated by the service on the service itself

Some services provide value by managing the customer's information. They help the user to better visualize and organize information relevant to them while filtering out unimportant details. Other services allow for easy and secure exchange of information between users. Information is the primary output when customers use a tool or service and the collection and manipulation of this data creates value as well.

## Partners and suppliers
This dimension involves the organizations and individuals that have a relationship with the company. IT also involves contracts and other forms of agreement between these parties. We choose partners and suppliers in accordance with the company goals and culture - incompatible partnerships and supply sources can cause conflict within and even destroy the company's reputation and integrity.

We ensure that proper systems are in place to facilitate efficient relations with external parties and we use contractual agreements and policies to ensure those parties do what they promise to deliver on. Some other variables that can affect who we choose as partners and suppliers are scarcity/availability or resources, cost issues, subject matter expertise, external constraints such as policies and regulations and demand patterns.
