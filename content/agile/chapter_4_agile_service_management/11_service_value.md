# Service Value
Service providers help customers achieve a certain *result* while taking on certain *risks* and incurring the *costs* involved with the provision.

In order to have an advantage, we maximize the value we deliver while minimizing the risks and costs we accumulate.

## Results
An output is a deliverable (tangible or intangible) produced by performing an activity. A result is what a stakeholder receives via one or more outputs. We can use products and provide services in order to help customers to achieve an intended result.

We can create a demand for certain results - results that customers are not even aware they desire e.g. the desire to watch romantic comedies created by Netflix.

## Costs
This is the amount of money required to attain resources necessary to provide a service or to create a product. A consumer is concerned with two types of costs:
- costs eliminated by using the service
- costs incurred by using the service

A good service provider maximizes the former while decreasing the latter.

## Risks
These are events that can cause damage or loss or reduce the chances of success. Consumers are concerned about:
- risks eliminated by using the service
- risks imposed by using the service

A good service provider maximizes the former and minimizes the latter.

## Utility and warranty
Utility is the ability of the service to produce the expected outcome. The warranty is the statement that ensures that the product or service does as promised - it is the measuring stick against which the customer can determine if the service is and does what the provider says it is and does. An internet TV provider may claim to have 100 channels (utility) but if users cannot access majority of the channels on any given day then the service does not meet the warranty (the expected value).
