# Service Management in the Context of Digital Transformation
We encourage good management because of its role in driving business and providing a competitive advantage for the company. ICT-base services such as cloud computing, IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), Saas (Software as a Service), block chain and machine learning are becoming more common and thus it is important that we manage these services.

Regardless of the ICT nature of this digital transformation of services, the underlying value is derived from the new way in which organizations do work and operate in an agile manner. These services help us to overcome boundaries in communication and to improve the overall efficiency of our company.

## Products, services and projects
Products are the result of an organization leveraging its resources (people, processes, tools, suppliers, technology) to create something of value to the client. The organization determines the aspects of a product that are visible to the consumer (the interface that they use to interact with the product) e.g. the consumer does not have to know about the internal parts of a phone in order to use it - they simply have to know the basics of using the touch screen.

Services enable the joint creation of value by creating the conditions and providing the resources necessary for the client to achieve a goal while reducing particular costs and risks associated with achieving that goal. When someone uses an online payment system, they do not have to visit the bank in order to pay for an item online. The payment system saves them time and money associated with a trip to the bank as they can now make payments from the comfort of their home. Services can fall into the following categories:
- customer services
- process automation
- business management services
- digital asset services
- business analytics services
- back office services
- support services

Projects are the investment to create a product or set up the facilities required to provide a service.

## Service value system
This represents how the components and activities of the company work in tandem to facilitate the creation of value by offering services. The components of a service value system are:
- the service value chain
- service management practices
- the guiding principles of service management
- government services
- continuous improvement

We need to have an adaptable service value chain in order to have a successful agile project.

## Dimensional model
There are four (4) dimensions necessary for a holistic vision of service management:
- organizations and people
- information and technology
- partners and suppliers
- value chains and processes

We cannot avoid these dimensions if we are to have effective service management.
