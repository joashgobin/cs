# Foundations of Service Management
There is a difference between project management and service management. Projects have:
- deadlines
- a budget
- a specified scope
- a project plan
- baselines
- change management

Services on the other hand have:
- no deadlines
- performance metrics
- no specified scope
- capacity management

Services do not have the triple constraint (time, cost and scope). We instead measure a service by its capacity - how many people can it deliver value to and how much value does each person receive. We also have to distinguish between the persons we choose to serve - serving one person might not be as beneficial or might lead to more risk compared to serving another.

Projects and services do however have the following in common:
- people
- change
- leadership

## Service level agreements
These are the metrics we use to evaluate service management. These indicate the capacity of the service e.g. how many persons did we successfully sell to, how long did each customer have to wait before receiving their order, how long was the server running throughout the week without interruption, etc.

## High-speed service delivery
When trying to have a competitive advantage and distinguish ourselves from competitors, we need to have a high velocity. If you can offer to deliver more value in a shorter period of time or produce a product earlier than another company to the same standard then your company is the better option.

For a high-speed service, we:
- focus on fast delivery of better services
- have continuous analysis of the feedback from the client for each service
- facilitate agility in the feedback process, thus producing high speed continuous improvement
- have an end-to-end approach to the service life cycle
- integrate product and service management practices
- digitize IT infrastructure and adopt cloud computing
- have extensive automation of the service provision chain
