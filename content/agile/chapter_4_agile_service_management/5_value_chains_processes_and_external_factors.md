# Value chains, Processes and External Factors
We care about value chains and flows in services and service management. This dimension is concerned with how the different parts of an organization operate as a whole (when integrated) in order to create value for the customers via goods and/or services.

We organize our activities and conduct them in a way that efficiently delivers the product or service to the client, keeping systems that work and discarding or refactoring systems that don't. A *value chain* refers to a series of processes/actions that the company follows in order to produce business value. A subset of this chain is referred to as a *value stream*.

## Value stream optimization
By identifying the value streams from the set of tasks that the company does, we can optimize to ensure that more business value is produced in a shorter amount of time. An example of a value stream is the set of steps it takes to prepare and send an email invite for an event to the customer:
>Design the email > Insert the content > Insert the recipient's email address > Press send

There are emailing services that have design templates to choose from, that generate the content for the email and do the email sending automatically. Using such an emailing service improves this value stream so that we spend less time on such tasks but still are able to invite our customers to attend the event. What might have taken 2 hours now can be done in 2 minutes.

Optimization of value streams also means eliminating any processes that waste company resources - these create too little business value for a given investment of time or resources. If it takes 10 dollars to make a call to try and sale a product to a customer but it takes the same 10 dollars to run an online advertisement that will be seen by 10,000 potential customers, 50 of whom will see and buy, then making calls is wasteful to the company.

## Processes
These are activities that take an input and produce an output. We can define a process with a flowchart or a RACI (responsible, accountable, consulted, informed) matrix. We can find value streams by analyzing flow charts of the company's processes.

## External factors
The work environment, government policies, regulations, constraints within suppliers and partners and other factors can affect our ability to deliver value. PESTLE (political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental) is a framework that can be used to study external factors.

For example, products that are considered to be environmentally friendly alternatives to leading brands have a selective edge in certain health-conscious social circles. A service can be banned from a country if it does not handle customer data in accordance with data protection laws. Companies that offer vegan and gluten-free options have an advantage in a market that does not cater for such audiences.
