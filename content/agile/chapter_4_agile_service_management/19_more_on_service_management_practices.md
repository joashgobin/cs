# More on Service Management Practices
Organizational change management is important in mitigating any negative effects in implementing change in the organization. Improvement can affect the way people work, their roles and their behaviour so we need to have systems in place to ensure a smooth transition.

Individuals and teams are taught to accept the changes and then support them. Organizational change management requires:
- clear and relevant objectives
- strong and committed leadership
- willing and prepared participants

## Portfolio management
This is a coordinated collection of strategic decisions that are used to achieve a balance between organizational change and day-to-day business. The key activities are:
- development and application of a system framework to define and deliver a portfolio of products, services, programs and projects in support of specific strategies and objectives
- clear definition of products and services and linking them to the achievement of agreed results
- evaluation and prioritization of incoming product, service or project proposals and other change initiatives based on resource constraints, existing commitments and the organization's strategies and goals
- implementation of a strategic investment assessment and decision-making process based on an understanding of value, costs, risks, resource constraints, interdependencies and the impact on existing business activities
- analysis and monitoring of investments based on the value of products, services, programs and projects for the organization and its clients
- monitoring the performance of the overall portfolio and proposal of adjustments in response to any changes in organizational priorities
- review of portfolios with respect to progress, results, costs, risks, benefits and strategic contribution

The organization can have a portfolio of products, services, programs, projects and even of clients.

## Risk management
We need to understand and effectively manage risks in the organization. By providing products and services, the organization takes on certain risks and thus it is essential that we know how to manage risks.

In risk management, we:
- identify the risk
- assess the risk
- plan our response to the risk

The following principles apply to risk management:
- risk is a part of business
- risk management must be consistent throughout the organization
- risk management culture and behaviours are important (use of proactive management behaviours, active promotion of and follow-up for notification of risks and incidents and opportunities, compensation structures for desirable behaviours, guarantee of transparency, etc)

## Financial management
This ensures that the organization's financial resources and investments are used effectively. The three(3) key activities are:
- budgeting/allocating - controlling income and expenditure
- accounting - tracking how money is spent
- billing/charging - billing service consumers
