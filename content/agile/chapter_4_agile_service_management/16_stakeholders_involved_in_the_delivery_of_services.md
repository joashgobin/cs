# Stakeholders Involved in the Delivery of Services
Stakeholders are the persons and companies who can be affected positively or negatively by a service.

## Service providers
This is the organization which makes a service available to users/customers. Services can also be provided to individuals within that same organization.

An organization can provide a service and also being using services provided by other organizations.

## Service consumers
These are persons or organizations that use a service. There are three (3) categories of consumers:
- customers - the person that pays for the service
- users - the person that uses the service and experiences the benefits involved
- sponsors - the person that authorizes the budget for the consumption of the service

## Other interested parties
Some other parties include government, investors, company shareholders, regulatory entities and social groups. It is important that stakeholders have similar interests to the organization because disparities in goals can lead to conflict later on.
