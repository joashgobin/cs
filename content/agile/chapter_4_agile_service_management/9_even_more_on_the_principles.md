# Even More on the Principles
We progress iteratively. Do not try to do everything all at once. Focus efforts on what can deliver the most value and what can help make future work easier. Remember that incomplete work does not deliver business value and thus leaves a project in a state vulnerable to loss so we reduce the size of the tasks to make managing risks easier.

We try to gain feedback before, during and after each iteration and make use of this feedback in deciding the way forward for a given venture. This reduces the risk of wasted work as our efforts will be focused on what the customer wants instead of just pure speculation. A feedback loop allows for us to collect data, analyze it and integrate the inferences with our current actions.

By time boxing each iteration, we place a limit on the maximum amount of work that can possibly go to waste. It also gives us a fixed time window in which we can collect feedback, process it and adjust our work based on the results. We also will be able to respond faster to failures in delivering value as we will know very quickly what does and doesn't work.

## Collaborate and promote visibility
By ensuring that information is transparent and that everyone knows that they are an important part of a bigger vision, we et better outcomes due to increased engagement and lack of ambiguity. We prevent *silos* in the work team by encouraging communication and collaboration. This improves trust and understanding among team members.

When there is uncertainty, the work can slow down or even progress in an unintended direction. This is why we use information radiators when conducting agile projects and service management.

We must also foster collaboration with customers so that they can help us to deliver the most value to them. A good service provider facilitates a good relationship with and customer-centric results for customers - this is achieved through continuous feedback. We need to have regular contact with the customer even if we or they may think that it is cumbersome.

Poor visibility can affect the level of support received from stakeholders. They may get the impression that the work is being taken seriously when they just aren't seeing as much information as they should.
