# Service Value System
Service management is best executed as a system. An ecosystem is formed by an organization's value creation system and the customer and other organizations serves to create more and more value than any entity could by itself.

The driving forces/key inputs are opportunity and demand.

The value creation system comprises:
- guiding principles - recommendations that guide the organization
- government - how the organization is managed and directed
- service value chain - interconnected activities done by the organization to create a product or provide a service thus creating value
- practices - organizational resources designed to perform a job or achieve a goal
- continual improvement - recurring activity at all organizational levels to improve the amount of value delivered

The output is value.

## How the value system works
Value systems serve to prevent future and eliminate existing organizational silos where information flow stagnates and leads to issues in the company. We define the value streams and identify where there are blockages in the overall value chain of the organization.

Remember that delivering more value does not always mean increasing sales and revenue but rather catering for more customers to a greater degree while exhausting less organizational resources in the process. Any blockages can lead to more resources being wasted and less customers being served.

## Organizational agility and resilience
Agility is the ability to change direction in response to change and resilience is the ability to effectively respond and adapt to change. Both are needed in an organization.

## Opportunity, demand and value
Value is output whereas opportunity and demand are the inputs of the value system.

## Government
Proper management is important in the value system. We direct and control the organization by the following activities:
- evaluate
- lead
- monitor
