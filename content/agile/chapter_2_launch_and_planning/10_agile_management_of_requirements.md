# Agile Management of Requirements
In agile projects we manage requirements in such a way that is focused on maximizing
business value.

# Project backlog
The backlog is the result of reordering the list of requirements (the requirements
stack). It is what we have left after applying prioritization techniques (Kano, MoSCoW,
ranking prioritization). This backlog is available to all of the project's stakeholders.
