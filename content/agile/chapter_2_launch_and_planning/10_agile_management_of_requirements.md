# Agile Management of Requirements
In agile projects we manage requirements in such a way that is focused on maximizing
business value.

## Project backlog
The backlog is the result of reordering the list of requirements (the requirements
stack). It is what we have left after applying prioritization techniques (Kano, MoSCoW,
ranking prioritization). This backlog is available to all of the project's stakeholders.

In addition to being very unambiguous, the backlog must be easily readable - it should not be hard or not very long in order to find relevant information via the backlog. The term *stack* is used to describe the backlog because of the idea that the idea that we remove items from the top of the list like we would from a stack of books.

## Backlog grooming
This is the ongoing process of making changes to the backlog as we gain more information throughout the lifetime of the project.
We modify requirements as we communicate with the product owner (the business) to gain more information and prioritize the new requirement (position it on the stack). We then change the work plan based on the new requirements.

Some requirements will never be implemented after the whole grooming process is completed but this is not a bad thing. Agile serves to maximize the amount of business value delivered to the customer, not the number of features we can create.

## Sprint backlog
From the total work to be completed for the project, we divide this work up into sprints. This means that each sprint will have its own backlog, a subset of the project's current backlog.

## What to consider
- We need a product backlog
- We must prioritize requirements before we do the work associated with these requirements
- The backlog for the project must be groomed/updated throughout the project lifetime
