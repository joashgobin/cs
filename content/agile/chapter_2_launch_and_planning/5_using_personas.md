# Using Personas
A persona is a archetype/representation of someone who will be using your product or system. Agile focuses on delivering business value to our customers so it is important that we understand who our product is for and why it will be of value to them.

This is why we use personas - to never lose sight of who we are creating a product/service/system for. A persona does not have to be fully realistic or too specific. It can represent multiple users with a similar background or situation. The idea is to create fictitious characters who are modeled after the actual users/customers.

The format for personas is generally:
>*name* | *background* | *desire/need to be satisfied/met*
