# Limitation of Work in Progress
Work in progress (WIP) is used to refer to the set of tasks which have been started by the work team but have not yet been completed. There are some possible issues with having too much WIP:
- WIP implies that the current amount of work completed is not sufficient to be considered as a deliverable, thus it is using project resources without there being any visible returns. Because WIP is a risk, it is good to avoid having too much of it at any point in time
- WIP can hide bottlenecks (where our output slows down) which are easier to identify when the work team is dealing with less
- When reworking is necessary, WIP can lead to much wastage because the work done so far may be incompatible with the new requirements of the product/system

## The importance of WIP limits
Because of the risk involved with having too much WIP, in Kanban we use WIP limits for each column (phase) of the board. Where there are bottlenecks, we will clearly see the flow of cards across slowing down and even stopping. Such a task management system forces us to complete few tasks at a time and focus on doing them well rather than trying to deliver tens or hundreds of features without completing them.

## Relax
Make WIP limits based on the size of your team and the difficulty of tasks. There is hard-and-fast rule when it comes to figuring out WIP limits. If your Kanban board becomes too noisy and looks like a traffic jam then it's likely because your team is doing too much at any one time.
