# Agile Estimation of Requirements
In agile, we do not rely on project managers and analysts to predict the length of time for work to be completed. Instead, the work team estimates the size of each requirement and the tasks to complete for each.

Each member has a say as to the story points that will be assigned to each requirement.


## Planning poker
Voting is done using a deck of cards in the Fibonacci series (1,2,3,5,8,13,21,etc.). An alternative is using T-shirt sizes (S,M,L,XL,XXL).

Each person on the team assigns a number to the each requirement based on how work they perceive will be required to complete the requirement.

Everyone in the work team as well as the product owner participates in this exercise.

## Possible predicaments
Each person casts their votes. Based on the number of points, we determine the work for each requirement. We renegotiate if there are any conflicts in the points awarded.

## Results of poker
The work associated with the requirements will be estimated and we will be ready to complete the project roadmap.

## The idea of agile estimation
We apply estimates when we cook and shop for new clothes. It is reasonable for us to apply this to the work we undertake.
