# Business Case and Project Justification
When undertaking agile projects, we must first justify the financing of the project. The *business case* uses various metrics to provide justification for agile projects.

The business case appeals to the market demands, social needs, organizational
needs, legal requirements, etc. of a project. The business case is completed by the sponsor of the project.

## Metrics used in the business case
The following metrics are used in the business case to justify a project:

- **Net Present Value (NPV)** - this is the difference between the current value of
cash inflows and the cash outflows. It is a comparison of the cost invested today
and the actual value of future cash inflows after the investment in the project
has been made:
$$NPV=\frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t}$$
where $i$ is the interest rate as a percentage, $R_t$ is the initial investment and $t$ is the number of annum elapsed.

- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** - this is the discount rate that makes the net present
value of all cash flows equal to zero. It is the discount rate that causes the net
negative cash flow (costs) equal to the net positive cash flow (benefits).

- **Return on investment (ROI)** - this is the efficiency of an investment. It is also
referred to as the *investment margin*:
$$ROI=\frac{\text{Gain-Cost}}{\text{Cost}}$$
The ROI is usually expressed as a percentage.

- **Payback period** - this is the period of time required to recover the initial cost of an investment.

## Other factors to consider in decision-making
It is possible to launch a project at a loss (not prioritizing financial gain at the start)
in order to achieve the one of the following:
- working with a new client to give them a high performance product or system in order to get a specific advantage from that partner
- addressing an urgent issue that blocks the business from continuing as per normal
- creating a prototype or minimum viable product (MVP) faster in hopes of getting funding in the future. This is common for many game development studios and tech startups
- minimizing risks associated with doing a lot of upfront spending without having any indicators of profitability. The business gains by not losing

## The project charter
This is a document which describes the vision and goals of the project. It
serves as a high-level overview of the project plan, scope, organization and execution.

The project charter includes the following information:
- the vision (is unique and universal to everyone involved in the project)
- goals and objectives (what makes the end result profitable; how will we be able to say that all the work of the project has been completed?)
- values (the set of principles we will work according to during the project; e.g. daily relay of information with stakeholders, completing tasks 10% earlier than in previous projects, using better management tools)
-
