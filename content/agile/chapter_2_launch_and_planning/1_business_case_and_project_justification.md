# Business Case and Project Justification
When undertaking agile projects, we must first justify the financing of the project. The *business case* uses various metrics to provide justification for agile projects.

The business case appeals to the market demands, social needs, organizational 
needs, legal requirements, etc. of a project.The business case is completed by the sponsor of the project.

## Metrics used in the business case
The following metrics are used in the business case to justify a project:

- Net Present Value (NPV) - this is the difference between the current value of 
cash inflows and the cash outflows. It is a comparison of the cost invested today 
and the actual value of future cash inflows after the investment in the project 
has been made:
$$NPV=\frac{R_t}{(1+i)^t}$$
where $i$ is the interest rate as a percentage, $R_t$ is the initial investment and $t$ is the number of annum elapsed.

- Internal Rate of Return (IRR) - this is the discount rate that makes the net present 
value of all cash flows equal to zero. It is the discount rate that causes the net 
negative cash flow (costs) equal to the net positive cash flow (benefits).

- Return on investment (ROI) - this is the efficiency of an investment. It is also 
referred to as the *investment margin*:
$$ROI=\frac{\text{Gain from investment-Cost of investment}}{\text{Cost of investment}}$$
The ROI is usually expressed as a percentage.

- Payback period - this is the period of time required to recover the initial cost of an investment.
