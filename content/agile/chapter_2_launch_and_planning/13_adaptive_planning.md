# Adaptive Planning
Because of the ever-changing nature of various industries, we need to be adaptive in our planning. It takes a lot of time and resources to fight against changes so it is better that we welcome new information and change our plans accordingly.

We employ *agile planning horizons*:
- viability analysis of the project
- preparation of the project roadmap
- preparation of a release plan
- planning of each iteration in conjunction with Kanban
- managing daily work (through daily meetings)

## Feasibility analysis
This is done before we undertake any work to create a product or system. This analysis involves searching for information on where a business need exists, the possible solutions to cater for that need, the ROI (return on investment) for each solution and the final decision as to which solution is the most feasible.

A solution may be disqualified if it does not align with the company's plans or if it will not garner support from management. We also consider how early we can have ROI.

## The meaning of adaptive planning
Agile means that we have the ability to adapt to change and move a different direction at any time. Adaptive planning speaks to this philosophy being applied to the way we plan our projects.

Traditional approaches to planning assume that the state of the market before the project will be the same as that at the project end. This is a grave mistake because the current way of the world necessitates the expectation of change.

We do not fixate on preventing tomorrow's troubles but on adapting to them.

## Progressive elaboration
A 3-month project with weekly releases means we will have about 12 releases. We have demos at the end of each sprint to gain feedback from the product owner and other stakeholders on how much business value the customer will get from the results of our work.

At the end of each sprint, we gain information and make use of that information to the best of our ability. The result is a better work plan at the end of each iteration.

## Story points and relative estimation
These are associated with how we estimate and distribute the work to be done.
