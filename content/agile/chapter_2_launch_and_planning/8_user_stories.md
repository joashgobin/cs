# User Stories
This is technique used to describe the requirements associated with a persona. User stories are written from the user's/customer's perspective. They should consist of only the essential information that is required for the work team to build the product to cater for that persona.

User stories consist of:
- Card - the story must be short enough to fit on a small card. This forces us to think about having only important information summarized in the story
- Conversation - The user story comes from a conversation about who we are building the product for. This conversation is between the product owner and the work team
- Confirmation - The story is written in a clear way such that we will be able to say definitively (confirm) if the work to fulfill the requirement has been completed

## Writing user stories
One side contains the story text written in the form: As *User*, I need *functionality or attribute* for *desired result*.

On the back of the card, we place the acceptance criteria for the story. These are important because we want our product to not only be functional but also to perform its function very well.

## I.N.V.E.S.T.
Good user stories are:
- Independent - Dependencies require us to reorder the list of requirements, a process which should have already taken place
- Negotiable - Stories should be malleable as we gain more information about and have more discussions centered around the persona
- Valuable - The customer must gain business value from the requirement being fulfilled
- Estimable - We should be able to read a user story and give an estimate as to the amount of time that it would take to implement that requirement
- Small - Stories should be small enough to implement within a single iteration. If a story is too large then it should be divided into multiple smaller stories
- Timely - The lifetime of a story should be at most one (1) iteration

## Examples
>As a teacher, I want to be able to tally my students' grades electronically so that I can tally and input them into the reports in a timely manner

Acceptance criteria:
- Words cannot be input where scores are expected
- Values for averages and ranks are calculated automatically (no formula entry required)
- A teacher will only be able to edit the grades of their students (thus preventing them from accidentally changing the wrong set of grades)
- Data is saved automatically (no need to press a save button)
- The state of a grade sheet can be reverted to that of a previous date (for comparison or backup)

## Epics and Themes
An epic is a user story that is too large to be completed in a single iteration - its scope requires too much work effort.
>As a teacher, I want to be able to manage all of my classrooms and complete all of my reports and administrative documents.

A theme is a collection of related user stories.
>As a teacher, I want to be able to add student grades.
As a teacher, I want to be able to delete student grades.
As a teacher, I want to manage the list of students in my class.

## User stories are not specifications
Specifications are detailed descriptions of requirements and the state of the final product whereas a user story tells us the minimum information about a requirement that is necessary for the work to be started.

User stories are easier to prepare and require less knowledge of the final product.
