# Roadmap
This is a tool that agile teams to map out the timeline of the project - what the project will deliver in terms of business value and when.

## Feasibility analysis
In this process, we determine what business need there is, what solutions might be able to cater for that need, the ROI for each of these solutions and we decide on which solution would be the most feasible.

Remember that ROI can help us to pinpoint a profitable business venture for the work team but the final decision as to which solution to use is influenced by the values and vision for the company e.g. making a website that promotes gambling is antithetical to the goals of a company that aims to promote healthy habits in its customers.

## Roadmap elaboration
We take the number of story points for each requirement. We can calculate the work capacity of the teams from the number of hours each week per person:
$$capacity=\frac{30 hours}{1 person}\times 5 persons$$
$$capacity=150 hours$$

If we say that each story point is 12 hours of work, then the number of story points we can complete per week is:
$$\frac{150 hours}{12 hours/point}=12.5 points$$

Therefore, we can complete a single requirement which can 13 story points each week.

The roadmap for a 16-week project would thus be:
|It1|It2|It3|It4|...|It16|
|13 |13 |13 |13 |...|13|
