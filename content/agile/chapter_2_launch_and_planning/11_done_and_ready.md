# Done and Ready
It is important that we have definitions for *done* and *ready* for the various entities we manage in agile. These entities include requirements, sprints and the project itself.

## Defining done
If we fail to have this definition, we may very well do much more work than is required to deliver business value or even fail to meet the more important requirements of the project.

1. Done for requirements


2. Done for sprints


3. Done for the project
