# Tools for Quality Part 2
Ishikawa (fish bone) diagrams help us to identify causes and effects. All of the possible causes flow into the result and this makes it easier to spot and address the root causes of a defect or error.

## Control charts
These are used to track the actual values of quality control metrics relative to upper and lower control limits. Within these control limits are upper and lower specification limits - if the metrics fall outside of these then we must intervene to correct the system to ensure less occurrences of falling outside.

## The 5 "why's"
- Why haven't we been able to release the result as promised?
- Why were people missing to do the work?
- Why wasn't the rest of the work team aware of this circumstance?
- Why don't we have a holidays request and registration form system?
- Why do we need to know the absences in planning time?

## FMEA (Failure mode and effects analysis)
This is also known as "pain factor analysis". This uses a matrix to help with visualization of risks in a qualitative way by indicating the "level of pain".
