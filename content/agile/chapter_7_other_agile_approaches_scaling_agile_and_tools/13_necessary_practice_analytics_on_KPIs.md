# Necessary Practice: Analytics on KPIs
We do not record and represent KPIs as a benefit in itself. We gain value from when we analyze these KPI values and draw conclusions from them. There are 4 levels of analytics:
- descriptive - what has happened?
- diagnostic - why did it happen?
- predictive - what will happen?
- prescriptive - what do I have to do to make it happen? If it happens, what is the best thing I can do?
