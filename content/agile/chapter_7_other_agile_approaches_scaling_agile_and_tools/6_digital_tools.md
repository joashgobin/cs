# Digital Tools
We use virtual teams software in other to bridge the physical gap caused by team members living and operating in different locations. We use information storage software in order to keep information safe (data security) and unaltered (data integrity) for future use.

## Necessary management elements
The minimal set of information and tools we need to have and use can be referred to as an agile project management kit. This consists of:
- The backlog - this is the stack of requirements, written as an ordered list of user stories, including the estimate for their construction. We need to have the name of the requirement or story, the estimation in story points or hours, and the priority
- The project roadmap - the roadmap is the structure of the project in releases and iterations. It is the initial and less detailed version of the project planning - it is a small drawing on paper or in any format. Zero iterations and consolidation iterations can be included for each release
- Each release plan - a release plan is made for each release. It shows what requirements we plan to build in each of the release iterations. The most comfortable presentation is a panel, in the form of a user story map, with a column for each iteration. A panel can be made for each release, or one with the whole project. In the column of each iteration, the cards (post-its) of the user stories that are planned for that iteration will be placed
- Kanban (task panel) - this is the most detailed representation of project planning, which only includes one iteration - it represents the tasks that solve user stories in an iteration. Kanban in itself is not enough to manage a project, only the current work planned for a short time - we need to employ other practices to ensure that Kanban does not go to waste
- Register of the action plans obtained in the retrospectives - this is necessary to make the work team aware that opportunities for improvement have been detected, so that these improvements can be applied in the following iterations to foster continuous improvement - the information radiators e.g. team radars that come from retrospective meetings are part of this register

## People solve problems
Tools, practices, experiences and common sense are only useful if we have the right people with the right attitude involved.
