# DevOps
We implement DevOps when we want to shorten the "time-to-market" for our software projects. DevOps is the amalgamation of Agile Development, Continuous Integration, Deployment and Operation.

DevOps is an approach that is focused on shortening the gap between development and operations. Deployment workflow is about moving the solution (be it a product or system) from development to production.

For effective DevOps, we need to:
- automate unit tests
- automate deployments
- automate alerts when deployments are made in each environment
- automate test execution
- take defect metrics in each environment and integration

Remember:
- it is easier to solve smaller problems that make up the larger issue
- optimize where there are bottlenecks
- metrics, metrics, metrics

## Innovations associated with DevOps
