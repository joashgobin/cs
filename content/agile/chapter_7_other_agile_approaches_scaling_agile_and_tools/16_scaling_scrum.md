# Scaling Scrum
Scrum is typically employed by small teams. It takes intentional planning and action to apply it effectively to larger teams. This is done by a "divide and conquer" project.

## Divide a project into parts
We can divide a work team of 27 persons into 3 Scrum teams of 9, each with their own Scrum Master and Product Owner. Each team will have:
- its own backlog
- daily meetings involving only members of the Scrum team
- reviews and retrospectives at the end of each iteration

We will thus have 3 Scrum projects serving to complete the original project.

## Scrum of scrums
Coordination of the project and the subprojects (Scrum projects) involved is done by the ceremony called "Scrum of Scrums". It is essential the daily stand-up for the Scrum Masters.

Rules include:
- 15 minutes in length
- no personal names
- each Scrum Master informs the Scrum of Scrums of the successes and failures of their own team, without mentioning names
- responsibilities lie with the team - if there is an issue it is dealt with by the corresponding Scrum team

The 4 questions asked in the Scrum of Scrums are:
- what has your team done since we last met
- what will your team do until we meet again
- is there something that slows your team on their way
- are you about to put something in the way of another team

## Advantages of scaling
There is only one true backlog. For large projects, this backlog is divided into smaller backlogs for the numerous Scrum teams to use.

If we have 3 Scrum teams then we divide the requirements in the backlog into 3. There must be an even distribution of the requirements ordered by priority - each team will have 1/3 of the high priority (the Must in MoSCoW) requirements, etc. If we made the mistake of giving one team the Must and the other teams the Should, Could and Would, we are essentially making one team's work more than that of the others - this would also cause many bottlenecks in the work as one team waits for the other team to finish a prerequisite higher priority requirement.

## Product owner proxy
The "Proxy" or unique Product Owner is the person who validates the integration of the different parts, sub-products or results of each subproject.

If a project is too large, we can have a program (a set of projects with some relationship among them) and run the projects under this program independently at different times, especially if we are limited in staff or would have to create tens or hundreds of Scrum teams for the very large project.
