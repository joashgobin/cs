# Last Planner System for Manufacturing and Production
LPS adapted to manufacturing environments is Materials Requirements Planning(MRP). This is a subset of what is called Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Manufacturing Execution System(MES).

In LPS, we:
- promote visual management on-site and in-office

- develop communication and commitment

## Improving the LPS
We can have:
