# Components of the Last Planner System Part 2
Let us look at the other types of planning/scheduling.

## Phased scheduling
These are only necessary for long and complex projects. The phased schedule represents a more detailed subdivision of the master schedule, prepared by the people administering the work in the phase, to support meeting the master schedule's milestones.

## Intermediate scheduling
This is also known as the lookahead. This plan can range from 1 month to 4 months in length. It answers what "can" be done.

The supplies necessary for the development of the activities, and those responsible for them are identified and incorporated. The flow tasks necessary to advance the development of the master planning, such as inspections, tests, trials, interventions of external agents, etc. are programmed so that when incorporated into the programming they are not a focus of imbalances and delays.

In the lookahead, we:
- try to match the flow with the work capacity, determining the optimal flow sequence
- break down the activities of the master plan into work packages
- develop detailed methods for executing jobs
- remove restrictions
- prepare executable tasks
- maintain an inventory of executable work
- update and revise the master plan if necessary

## Weekly work plan
We ask what "will" be done during the upcoming week. The activities will be a subset of the inventory of work prepared in the intermediate planning - this is the *weekly work plan (WWP)*.
