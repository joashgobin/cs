# SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)
This is a framework used to scale the agile approach at a corporate level. Some of its solutions include:
- data intake, warehousing and integration
- processing and preparation for inquiries
- visualization, reporting, extractions, etc.
- definition and obtaining of KPIs (added value)
- "integration project" a.k.a. solution train
- solution demos
- solution managers and owners
- global backlog

## Quality and transparency in SAFe
Quality must be ensured in each increment, release, project and solution.

Transparency is one of SAFe's key principles - working with information radiators and encouraging flow of information in the work team and company.

## Basic principles
- agile and Lean principles
- agile teams and agile train
- cadence and synchronization
- PI (Program Increment) planning
- DevOps
- system demo
- "inspect and adapt"
- learning, improvement
- long-term architectural vision
- agile leadership
- measure the 7 types of waste

## ART (Agile Release Trains) components
ARTs are central to SAFe and they reflect the idea that if each project iterates and fulfills its roadmap, then we must find a way for many projects to integrate their results to that same pace and be able to deploy and use the joint result as soon as possible, in production (via DevOps).

We consider the implications for integration at the levels of hardware architecture, security, integrated tests, joint business validations, etc.
