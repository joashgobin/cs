# Tools for Quality
Quality is the degree to/closeness with which we can fulfill the customer's requirement.

## How we can measure quality and tools we can use
Measuring quality will entail having an objective way of determining how close or far we are from the requirement. We ask:
- What metrics do we want to obtain?
- What target values should they meet?
- How do we want to visualize the distance of the actual metrics regarding those target values?

Improvement in project management is thus trying to have the actual values of the quality metrics match the target values.

## Quality control vs. quality assurance
Quality control (a reactive process) is about making decisions based on new information on quality metrics in order to push the current actual value closer to the target value.

Quality assurance (a proactive process) is where we design the processes that will be executed, their inputs and outputs, the triggers, design the metrics to be taken, decide what their target values are. QC is a subset of QA and QA precedes QC.

Some tools we use for quality control are:
- histograms
- Pareto diagrams
- Ishikawa (fish bone) diagrams
- flow charts
- control charts
- the "5 why's"

Pareto diagrams mirror the Pareto principle:
- 80% of work time is consumed in 20% of the tasks
- 80% of problems arise from  20% of the project elements
- 80% of the cost is invested in 20% of the resources
- 80% of defects arise from 20% of the subsystems
- 80% of the users use only 20% of the functionality
- other examples

We use flow charts and RACI matrices to define processes.
