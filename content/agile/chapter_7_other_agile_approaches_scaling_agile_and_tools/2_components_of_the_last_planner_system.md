# Components of the Last Planner System
The components are:
- advanced planning - where we do not authorize any activity on schedule unless planners are confident that restrictions can be removed in time
- commitment to planning - commitments are measured by the Percent Plan Complete (PPC) which indicates whether the work was completed or not
- learning - where we review the work plan weekly to see what tasks have been completed - if the commitment has not been kept, the reason must be indicated

The last planner must consider quality criteria before committing the workers to do the work:
- master plan (should do)
- lookahead plan (can do)
- weekly plan (will do)
- weekly control (did)

## Master schedule and pull session
This contains the "should" tasks. We identify those responsible for compliance with each part of the program, incorporate the suppliers and subcontractors involved in each scheduled activity - these people are referred to as the "last planners". The "first planner" would be the engineer who plans the work in isolation, in the office.

Through a *pull session*, you can include the relationships between different tasks and suppliers, industrialists, and subcontractors, and define a period of the program they should act and the possible interactions between them. We also identify the external actors on whom the execution of the programmed activities depends.

## LPS vs. Traditional
LPS:
- non-deductive
- horizontal involvement
- vertical involvement
- continuous improvement through continuous learning, measuring of PPC, causal analysis and sharing of experience
- pull-based project control through reversed scheduling and removal of constraints towards construction
- simple and manual planning technique

Traditional:
- deductive
- limited involvement - mainly expert planning
- monthly reports e.g. earned value reports - lessons learned until after the project is complete
- centralized critical path method in planning and pushing the work towards downstream activities
- computer-based expert planning

## How to conduct a pull session
1. Write a completion date of the work (as a milestone) on the right side of the board
2. What is the last task we should complete to meet that milestone (end-date)?
3. The last planner responsible for the task writes the necessary information on a card and the facilitator sticks it on the board of the left of the milestone. The card includes the company (shown with a specific color), tasks, deadline, necessary resources, and restrictions
4. What is the task(s) that precedes the one on the board?
5. Determine if there is any overlap between these two tasks (successor and predecessor), and the overlap (if any) is reported
6. Are there more tasks that precede the one on the board? Repeat steps 4 and 5 for each of them
7. When the answer is no, the pull session has ended
8. Review all tasks to ensure that everyone agrees, making necessary adjustments. The site manager and project manager have to check the logic of the construction and ask questions of the other participants, if necessary, to check that the deadlines and resources are adequate. If issues arise, the managers:
    - identify conflicts in the sequencing of tasks
    - assess the possibility of overlapping tasks
    - consider the option of reducing the duration of tasks (perhaps by using more resources)
    - identify probable risks
    - focus on the critical path
    - move tasks that are not on the critical path considering their slack
