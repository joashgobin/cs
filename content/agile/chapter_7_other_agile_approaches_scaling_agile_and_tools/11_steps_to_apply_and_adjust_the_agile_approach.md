# Steps to Apply and Adjust the Agile Approach
It is necessary to progressively implement a new methodology in phases - applying a new methodology requires good planning. A change in methodology cannot happen overnight.

We can start with recording tasks completed, and then start using the Kanban board. Then we can introduce the team to writing user stories, planning iteration and creating roadmaps.

## Basic practices
We can slowly implement the following:
- recording basic metrics like time taken and work completed
- do we know how much each item and task costs?
- earned value in projects
- taking lessons learned
- basic risk management kit (having risk impact categories and probabilities for each risk)
- quality control processes
- establish the meaning of the 5 S's
- establish the meaning of zero defects - and aim to get as close as possible to it
- do we have defined management processes?
- identify tasks and products that do not add value
- reflect on the leadership style
- map inefficiencies with flaws or technological deficiencies
