# Last Planner System (LPS)
Production planning in the traditional approach is poorly suited to deal with uncertainty and variability during construction. Lean Production is a method developed by automobile factories in response to the inadequacies of traditional planning.

The Last Planner System is based on the same principles (of Lean construction philosophy) and proposes modifying the work scheduling and control process to create a stake work environment, thereby protecting production from uncertainty and variability.

The LPS works in harmony with traditional methods to produce greater value. While network methods handle the critical path, dates, and managing contracts, the LPS handles variability, workflows, and managing interdependencies.

The Last Planner is the last person capable of ensuring a predictable downstream workflow by assigning the work tasks directly to the workers - this forms a pull system where the downstream activity of planning drives and sets the pace.

The LPS adds a production control component and reframes "what should be done" into "what can be done".

## Why are the works delayed?
Traditional planning does not consider the host of variables involved - planning involves making too many assumptions and does not cater for a high degree of uncertainty. Some of these unaccounted variables are availability of stock from the suppliers, the lack of definition of designs and requirements, the problems of labour, administrative problems, of incorrectly estimated yields.

## How can this situation be reversed?
We need to identify what what can be done before we can narrow it down and decide what will be done. The focus is on avoiding any stoppages in the work. By aiming to maximize what can be done at any point in time, we avoid having to choose from a small pool of possible actions.

Managers must target the root cause instead of trying to buffer the issue by solving less important causes - it is better to find a way to get more cooking gas than to cooking smaller portion sizes for customers.

We start with a lower degree of detail (zoom out) at the beginning of the project and increase the degree of detail (zoom in) as we gain more information from the project's progress.

The forms of planning are:
- Long-term: initial planning or master plan - establishes the strategic objectives and main milestones, defining few activities using the WBS
- Medium-term: intermediate planning or lookahead planning - optimize production, analyzing constraints and conflicts to eliminate bottlenecks, at a lower level using more detailed activities
- Short-term: weekly planning - prepare weekly plan in a weekly meeting, with the participation of the last decision-makers or planners (managers, foremen, subcontractors, warehousemen, etc.) as part of the inventory of executable activities obtained in the intermediate planning, attributing the activities in high detail to the responsible parties, at the lowest level of the WBS
- Control and feedback - the last planners meet to verify the compliance with the weekly plan, detecting the causes of non-compliance with what was planned, and establishing the plan for the following week. The results are made visible alongside the performance of the parties involved. We use the Percent Plan Complete (PPC) metric to measure the plan reliability.
