# Tools on the Market: Redmine and Trello
Redmine allows complete project management - including  management i.e. registration of user stories, reordering them by dragging up and down, and the estimation of their story points.

It allows release plan creation and visual management, dragging requirements to their iteration and allowing them to be grouped into releases. There is also Kanban and registration of the daily incurred. Burndown charts are also available.

## Trello
This is Kanban collaboration app. The main use involves creating and dragging cards on the task panel, sharing comments among work team members using mobile phones. It does not have any other features specific to agile management so we have to use it in addition to other software for a full project management experience.
