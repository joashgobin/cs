# Components of the Last Planner System Part 3
The LPS has been successfully applied in numerous projects around the world. Some noteworthy improvements cited by managers are:
- improved project management and control
- greater involvement of middle managers thanks to a more active role in project managers and their greater commitment to planning
- a decrease in urgent and unforeseen orders
- higher productivity of the processes, although in some cases it cannot be measured directly
- shorter execution times for the work

LPS is a cascade planning and control technique whose main purpose, in addition to controlling production, is to reduce the variability of the work through the application of the 3 basic principles:
- Coordination of the last planners (those who really decide on the work) through periodic meetings
- The personal commitment of the final decision-makers (last planners)
- Public visibility of the weekly results obtained

The basic control indicator is the Percent Plan Complete(PPC).

## Quality control and delegation of downstream responsibilities
For good quality control, we need to:
- identify the quality failure as close as possible to the execution of the activity
- motivate operators with incentives on quality issues, and quality inspection

Operators should be able to stop the work if they observe errors or serious failures in the construction process and make their proper decisions if they observe minor errors that can be easily solved. Decentralization of competence in planning is a key feature of LPS.
