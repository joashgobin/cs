# Agile, Lean and Design Thinking for Product Development
We welcome change, minimize waste and target user-centered design for maximum yield.

Some aspects of design thinking are:
- open mentality
- prototyping
- take nothing for granted
- prevent prejudice
- learn in a practical way
- direct contact with users and clients
- encourage creativity
- make innovation possible

Some aspects of Lean are:
- do not do what is not necessary
- do more of what adds more value
- learn continuously
- accept the change
- optimize

Some aspects of agile are:
- build iteratively
- build incrementally
- work based on iterations
- people at the center
- light process
- adaptation to change
- flexibility

## Union of the 3 approaches for other contexts
Some contexts where these 3 approaches work well together are:
- project management
- service management
- department management
- industrial manufacturing contexts
