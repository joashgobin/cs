# Agile Contracts
The agile values have us focus on collaboration over contracts but many projects have a legal aspect that we have to carefully navigate in order to avoid issues for the company. Recall that agile fixes the time and cost and allows the scope of the project to vary. This can be tricky to use where clients traditionally expect to spend a fixed amount, wait for a fixed period of time and receive a fixed outcome for the results of the work done (a predetermined scope).

Many clients expect a fixed cost, time and scope to be stated in contracts. Clients may be not very inclined to sign contracts where the scope is not fixed - that is to say, it is possible that not all of the features they expect will be implemented. Agile contracts are thus different from traditional contracts.

## Types of agile contracts
- "Money for nothing and change for free"
- Graduated fixed-price contracts
- Fixed-price work packages
- DSDM contracts
- Custom contracts
