# Analysis of the Agile Process
The analysis of processes is related to process "tailoring" and the principles of design thinking. Process analysis is about finding out the problems with using agile methods and adjusting these methods as required. The anti-patterns we may fall into using are:
- one size for all projects - using the same methodology for every project
- intolerance - being too strict with processes and not giving the team autonomy
- excessive amplitude - adding practices and artifacts to a methodology in hopes of making it safer or easier to follow
- over-adorned - saying certain practices "could" or "should" help the project without any evidence
- unproven - using untested methodologies
- used only once - using methodologies that do not have a track record of positive outcomes

We can use the success criteria:
- the project is released
- leadership remains intact
- the people on the project would work the same way again

## Principles to follow
- face-to-face and interactive communication is best
- the excess weight of the methodology is expensive
- larger teams need heavier methodologies
- more meetings are only appropriate for more critical projects
- increasing feedback and communication reduces the need for intermediate deliverables
- discipline, skills and understanding/knowledge is preferable over process, formality and documentation
- maximum efficiency is not very beneficial in non-bottleneck activities

## Applying agile practices
When seeking to apply new practices to your work, consider the following:
- is there a natural solution - do not add more practices or approaches instead of addressing the root cause of a problem
- do proper research
- try small doses - use the new practice in an iteration or two
- review the side effects - examine any practice you adopt for a while, in retrospect and consider if you should continue using it or an alternative practice or none at all
