# How does Google do it?
Here is how Google operates.

## Google Design Sprints
This is a shortcut to learn without actually having to build and launch a product. They design a product and answer critical questions.

## Agile project management
In managing a project, there are:
- 3 roles:
    - product owner
    - scrum master
    - work team
- iterations of about a week
- transparent and continuous communication

## Five-day process
The designing of a viable product is done in only 5 days (map, sketch, decide, prototype, test).

## Advantages of the Design Sprint Approach
- profitability
- fewer product development cycles
- product validation
- measurable
- versatile (launch a new product or business, evaluate the viability of a new business, create new product features, create an MVP roadmap, create new marketing strategies, come up with a specific part of a product)
