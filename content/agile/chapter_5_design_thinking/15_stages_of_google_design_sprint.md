# Stages of Google Design Sprint
The Design Sprint is led by the scrum master

## Monday: understand the problem
- identify the users (Who are the target customers?)
- determine their needs (What would make them buy the product?)
- create the context (What is the product about?)
- review competitors (Who else is making or has made the same product?)
- formulate strategy (What is the best way to achieve the target results?)

We can reverse engineer the problem as a good practice.

## Tuesday: sketch the solutions
- review the existing product ideas
- outline the solutions

In developing the sketches:
- take good ideas from competitors
- distribute the work (drawing different parts of the map)
- generate the sketches:
    - take notes
    - sketch ideas
    - sketch solutions
    - deliver the outlined solutions to the facilitator

## Wednesday: make decisions
Voting is done:
- display the sketches on a wall in a long row
- each team member places 1 of 3 stickers, each having from 0 to 5
- discuss major highlights and objections as a team
- a design is chosen

## Thursday: build a prototype
- divide the storyboard in smaller "scenes"
- assign each team member a task to do on the same day
- write a script of the prototype "demo"

## Friday: show the prototype
- interview customers/users to get their reactions to the prototype
- record the interviews and review afterwards
- try to do it in person
- question - help the clients summarize their views
- evaluate - look back at the storyboard and categorize customer response patterns as positive, neutral or negative
- continue based on what has been learned
