# Methods for Identifying User Needs
In order to identify what is important to our customers, we need to:
- analyze existing data
- interview stakeholders - using the Five Why's technique and live voice surveys
- map the customer process - what do they do in order to cope with a certain issue
- "follow me home" method - observe the client for a period of time and make note of the *pain points* they experience
- map the customer journey - visualize the process a customer goes through when using a product or service and identify points of friction and opportunities for improvement
- analyze the competition - do research of other companies in the same domain and even other industries and do SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis for their solutions
- analyze cause-and-effect relationships
- record experiences through daily studies - ask customers to record their problems, frustrations, positive and negative experiences and thoughts at intervals throughout the day, week or month
