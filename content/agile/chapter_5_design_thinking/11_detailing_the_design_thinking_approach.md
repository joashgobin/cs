# Detailing the Design Thinking Approach
Focus on the customer - do not make assumptions about their situation. Everyone in the organization needs to understand the user's needs. Focus on what they need now and what they may need in the future.

 Ethnographic research (in-depth interviews, observation, shadowing, co-creation) is an important method for understanding people's behaviours and experiences and emotions.

## Expand the user's point of view
We ask what are the most important problems of our users. We use the client's feedback to guide us in what we focus on. People communicate on three(3) levels:
- value level - the values that people want to be fulfilled in their lives
- level of needs - the rational and emotional needs of the people
- solutions level - specific design principles that can guide development of new products, services and experiences that meet the needs and desires of the people

## A new perspective
Try to reframe the situation as much as possible - do not rely on past experiences and assumptions.

## Benefits of design thinking for companies
- greater empathy with the customer
- collaboration creates new value
- minimized risk and improved ROI
- creation of a competitive advantage and encouragement of growth
