# Step Five: Test
We need to test the solution implemented within the current design. If users experience difficulty, this indicates that the current design might be sub-optimal and we have to review the possible solutions to decide on a better alternative.

This phase focuses on *user feedback*. We cannot iterate and increment on the design if we do not know the degree to which the current design is benefiting the user.

## How to do user tests
Try to use a natural environment to mimic real working and living conditions. If this natural environment is not possible, we try to simulate it as much as possible. Recreate the scenario as much as possible, do not over explain the prototype to the user (the best tutorial is an invisible one) and do not interrupt the user interaction when collecting feedback (freely observe).

## Guidelines for planning tests
- allow users to compare alternatives
- show rather than say; let users experience the prototype
- ask users to talk about their experience
- observe how users use, whether correctly (as intended) or incorrectly, the prototype; avoid correcting them because in real life you cannot do "hand-holding" for everyone
- ask follow-up questions

## The purpose of testing
Testing serves to help us to *find feasible solutions* - these are desirable (is it human-centered), doable (can it be created) and viable (will it deliver business value).
