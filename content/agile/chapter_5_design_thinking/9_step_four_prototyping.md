# Step Four: Prototyping
In this phase, we create a prototype (an early, inexpensive, reduced version of the product) which is used to reveal any flaws in the current design.

From the results, we can refine the product or redefine the problem from the previous phase. Prototypes are how we can validate or invalidate solutions without spending too much time and money on a full product that may or may not bring value to the user.

## Prototyping styles
- low-fidelity prototypes - incomplete basic models or examples of the product being tested
- high-fidelity prototypes - these look and operate closer to the finished product

## Tips for prototyping
- just start building
- do not spend too much time because prototyping is all abut velocity
- remember that you are testing
- build with the user in mind
