# Risk Monitoring
The biggest risk is in delivering a product or service that customers do not need or even desire. We need to maximize *value* and manage *risks*.

Agile helps us to manage risks:
- iterative work allows you to move high-risk work forward into the first iterations so that we can discover more information as soon as possible
- this will allow better estimation in successive iterations
- it may be worth building or implementing less product upfront so that we ensure productivity in subsequent iterations

We can analyze risk using two measures:
- the probability - how likely the risk will materialize (expressed as a percentage)
- the impact - the measure of the consequences should the risk occur (expressed as a monetary value)

The **severity of a risk** is the product of its probability and its impact. We list each risk and their probability. From this, the work team finds the severity of each risk. We can visualize the risk over time by using a burndown graph.

This represents the total and detailed (individual) evolution of risks over time, using different colors for different risks.
