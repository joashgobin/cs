# Failure Modes
You cannot expect to make the right choice in your first attempt every time. People make mistakes, are reluctant to change and accepting ideas from other people. This is not to be seen as a stressor but a natural characteristic of having to work in a team. There is value in working on trial-and-error approaches with incremental progress based on feedback.

We ask:
- Can we incur less in these failure modes?
- What can we do to reduce the consequences of these failure modes?

The concepts behind failure modes and their alternatives stem from the human aspect related to the performance and execution of processes. The five(5) failure modes (*the ways in which people make mistakes*) are:
- make mistakes
- choose to fail conservatively - defaulting to what is best known instead of what is best practice especially in cases of uncertainty
- invent instead of research - creating from scratch instead of exploring for existing solutions
- being creatures of habit practicing - reinforcing practice of what is wrong frequently
- being inconsistent - not practicing what is right infrequently
