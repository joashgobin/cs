# Step Two: Define the Problem
We need to define the problem in a meaningful and understandable way - we use the observations from our users to decide what is truly affecting them.

## Analysis and synthesis
In analysis, we break down complex concepts and problems into smaller, more understandable components. In synthesis, we piece together the extrapolated ideas to see the bigger picture.

## The correct way to pose the problem
We use a problem statement - this creates a sense of possibility and optimism that allows the team members to generate ideas at the ideation stage. Good problem statements are:
- human-centered
- wide enough for creative freedom
- small enough to be manageable

We can use mind maps and affinity diagrams to group similar ideas.

## Empathy map
This consists of a board, paper or table which reflects the key traits that the users demonstrate/possess during the observation stage.

## POV (Point Of View): problem statement
We state the user, the need and information. It can be written in the form of a user story. On the backside, we write the acceptance criteria. On the front is the user story's performance constraint (*"As a...I want...so that..."*).

## "How could we?"
We ask this question to kick-start the next phase (ideation). If we find that kids in highschool do not eat enough green, leafy vegetables, we might ask "How could we make these vegetables more readily available to the kids" if vegetables are scarce or "How could we make the vegetables more appealing" if the they are abundant.
