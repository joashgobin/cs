# Understanding Design Thinking
We think differently in order to ask important questions and *challenge assumptions*. We can consider previous assumptions to be false and investigate from that stance.

## Rationality and empathy
We do our best to understand the customer and generate "out of the box" solutions. We then use a rational selection process to decide on which on these innovation solutions is the most feasible. We integrate what humans desire with what is technically and economically feasible.

## Anyone can do design thinking
Design thinking benefits designers but it can also help employees, freelancers and leaders to create and promote efficient and innovative solutions to their daily issues.

Design-focused companies have a selective advantage over companies that do not intentionally employ design thinking.

## Advantages of design thinking
In design thinking:
- users have the highest priority
- the process directs collective knowledge
- we focus on empathy
- progress is made iteratively
- real user problems are solved
