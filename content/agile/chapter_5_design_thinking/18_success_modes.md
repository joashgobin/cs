# Success Modes
These are behaviours which can be used to counteract the "habitual failures" described by the failure modes. These success modes include:
- having the ability to look around us - observe, review and notice when things are not going well
- being able to learn - find ways to fix what is wrong when you see that things are not going well
- being malleable - having the humility to change and accept new ideas and approaches
- feeling proud of the work - doing work we may not have been assigned initially, for the greater good of the project or department, to a high degree of excellence regardless of if we are rewarded for it or not - be dogmatic in your work standard

Some strategies to overcome failure modes are:
- have a balance between discipline and tolerance - have a standard and encourage people to stick to it but do not be too harsh by not leaving room for error and experimentation
- start with something concrete and tangible - show, don't just tell
- copy and alter - modify what works instead of giving yourself "white sheet syndrome" by starting from scratch every time
- observe and listen - observe others and listen to them; this is especially useful for junior personnel to do with experts on the team
- support concentration and communication - have separate spaces for each ("caves" where people can concentrate and "commons" where people can communicate)
- assign appropriate jobs for each personality - place technical people in technical tasks, place creative people in creative tasks
- keep the best talent
- give infrequent, meaningful, appropriate rewards for encouragement
- combine rewards - reward people for meeting not just individual KPIs but also team KPIs
- choose feedback over complex analytical work
