# Fulfilling Objectives
Purpose answers why do we do it. The purpose keeps us aligned in the project.

## Metrics are important
Do not use "vanity" metrics like number of page views. Such metrics tell us nothing about the quality of experience the user has with your product. We need to be specific and intentional about the metrics we use to determine if the product is working or not. Number of purchases of an item is a more useful metric than the number of visits to the item's webpage. The length of time users can use your streaming service without interruption is a better metric than the number of movies you have listed.

## Decide based on learning
- Define your beliefs and assumptions (so that they can be tested)
- Decide what is most important to learn
- Design experiments that provide you with the chance to learn

## Diverse approaches, one team
We collaborate as a group of different individuals working towards a single goal - it does not matter who can talk more or  who is related to who. We do not discriminate in the generation of ideas and solutions.
