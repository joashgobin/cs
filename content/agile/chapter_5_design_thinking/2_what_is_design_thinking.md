# What is Design Thinking
Design thinking is an iterative approach to problem solving in which we seek to understand the user and design our products and services around what they perceive as valuable.

## Stages in design thinking
The Nobel laureate Herbert Simon first described design thinking principles in The Sciences of the Artificial in 1969. The five(5) phases are:
- empathize - understand people
- define - the needs, problems and ideas of your users
- ideate - devise challenging assumptions and create ideas for innovative solutions
- prototype - start creating solutions
- test - your solutions

These phases do not have to be sequential as we can do many of them simultaneously.

## "Out of the box" thinking
The natural way we may be inclined to solve a problem are often not sufficient for design thinking. Someone may simply steer their vehicle to the side in order to avoid a pothole. Such an action solves the issue of having to pay for repairs to the damage caused by the pothole. However, the innovative solution would be to fix the road and thus saving every driver the time wasted from having to steer to the side.

The acquired thought pattern (this is called a schema) of naturally avoiding the pothole can prevent us from looking at the bigger picture and thus solving the actual problem with the road. The entire field of entrepreneurship is centered on overcoming these schema and monetizing the solution(s) we create.

## Storytelling
We share stories to inspire opportunities, ideas and solutions. Stories provide accounts for specific events in real life - they are not general statements.

Stories help us to imagine solutions to problems which may not even involve us.
