# Step Three: Ideate
Here we generate as many ideas as possible in the form of questions and solutions through creative activities such as brainstorming  sessions and worst possible idea. We then narrow down to the most feasible option by imposing constraints onto the set of solutions.

Some best practices are:
- ask the right questions and innovate
- go beyond the obvious solutions
- gather the perspectives and strengths of team members
- discover unexpected areas of innovation
- create volume and variety in your innovation options

## Ideation methods for creating innovative ideas
- brainstorming
- brain dump
- brain write
- brain walk
- challenge assumptions
- SCAMPER
- mind map
- sketch or sketch storm
- storyboard
- analogies
- provocation
- body storming
- game storming
- cheat storm
- mass storm
- co-creation workshops
- prototypes
- creative pause

## Active facilitation
Ideation, being a creative process, requires concentration and having team members merely sit in a corporate meeting room and write ideas down might not be sufficient to stimulate their creative abilities to a high degree. Designate a scribe to write down ideas and have members actively participate in the brainstorming in a comfortable environment. If there is trouble in idea generation, introduce a constraint to focus in on a particular set of solutions. This designing by subtraction will help us avoid analysis paralysis.

## Brainstorming best practices
- set a time limit
- start with a problem statement, POV, possible questions, plan or goal, and stay focused on the topic
- stick to the topic
- defer judgement or criticism, including non-verbal
- encourage weird, wacky and wild ideas
- aim for quantity
- build on the ideas of others
- work visually
- have one conversation at a time

## Methods for selecting the best ideas
Some methods are:
- post-it voting or dot voting - each member writes on a post-it and we tally the votes
- four-category method - each member categorizes the ideas into one of four: *the rational choice*, *the most prone to delight*, *the darling*, *the remote possibility*.
