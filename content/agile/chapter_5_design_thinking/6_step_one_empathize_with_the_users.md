# Step One: Empathize with the Users
The process of design thinking beings with acquiring a deeper understanding of the people we are designing for - we look at their needs, thoughts, emotions and motivations. We care about how they think and what they deem to be valuable.

## Develop empathy towards people
We need to develop a sense of empathy towards people in order to gain insight on what they need and want, how they behave and think, and why they engage in such behaviours, feelings and thoughts when interacting with products and services.

Observation is the main tool we use as design thinkers in order to understand people.

## Consider yourself to be a beginner
We must get rid of any assumptions we have about the customer in favour of understanding the situation in which they live and the issues they face.

## Techniques to empathize
Some techniques we can utilize in order to empathize with the customer are:
- asking *what*, *how* and *why* - we record the details of what has happened, analyze how the person is doing what they do and ask why they do what they do (their motivations and emotions)
- studies of the user's videos and photos
- interviews
- engage "extreme users"
- analogous empathy - we develop new ideas for one field of work by observing other fields of work
- share inspiring stories - the members of the team do individual research on success stories and other stories and share with the team
- simulations aka "body storming" - try to simulate the experiences of the user by pretending to be them and recreating the environment in which they operate
