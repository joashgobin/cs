# Why Design Thinking
Design thinking is focused on understanding people and culture. We no longer rely on pure creativity in designing products and services but rather ensure we consider the context in which we are operating - the experiences and values of the people for whom we make products and services. People do not merely use a product and service because of its utility - there are other factors which affect a person's choice.

## The personalization of the idea of "value"
The value perceived and gained from a product or service is a personal metric. A typist uses a keyboard for a different reason compared to someone who plays games using that same keyboard - they receive different forms and degrees of value. The typist is able to complete their daily duties whereas the gamer gets satisfaction from achieving a high score.

## The customer is at the center
Companies can no longer beat their competition by mere brute force (e.g. having more factories, producing faster devices, etc.). They must now compete for the attention and adoration of consumers via social media marketing and social events.

The internet has revolutionized how we measure the performance and reach of companies - a small company with good marketing and great emotional appeal can compete with long-established giants in their fields.

## Improvement in terms of empathy
Companies now have to get customers to empathize with (feel close to) their brand. They must not only have a working and acceptable product or service but they must also make these appealing to customers.

Innovation teams follow some important principles to connect with consumers and achieve a desired result:
- establish a solid foundation of knowledge at the beginning of a project and review the objectives, constraints, assumptions, challenges and desired outcomes
- align with executive sponsors around the innovation intent using a clear, unambiguous and measurable mission shared across the team
- share, discuss and document knowledge related to the business context, business problem and target customer
- share freely the knowledge acquired in the company or from the learned lessons (current beliefs, project stories, etc) that exist in the organization and work through three fundamental questions (what do you know about your clients, what do you think you know about your clients, what do you not know but need to know about your clients) to identify knowledge gaps and sharpen the focus for the client's research plan

## Agility and design thinking
Agile values people over processes and design thinking is focused on meeting the needs and desires of people through design thus these two are a powerful combination.

The "Person" technique and other agile practices help us to do meaningful work by asking "for whom are we doing this" instead of obsessing on "what do we have to do".

Design thinking is agile because of the natural inclination of having to regularly create prototypes and have the consumer try them to see how much value is attained. We also have increments and iterations based on the consumer's reactions to these prototypes, in order to deliver more value:
>requirement > prototype > feedback > repeat

We care about what the user thinks about the product or service more than industry standards, common knowledge and past experiences.
