# Lean for Services
Measurement is essential to Lean management - we cannot control and improve upon what we are not aware of.

We also prioritize sections in the value flow where there is greater waste - no use in removing 1% waste somewhere when we should be focusing on the 10% waste somewhere else.

## TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) indicators: MTTR and MTBF
TPM is a methodology focused on measuring the times in which a service or product is contributing its value. Some of these times are:
- MTTD (mean time to detect)
- MTTR (mean time to repair)
- MTTRS (mean time to restore service)
- MTBF (mean time between failures)
- MTBSI (mean time between system incidents)

## Failure and incident
A failure occurs when a component stops or experiences a problem (overheating, slow-down, abnormal operation). It is considered to be an incident when the operation of the service, or the performance of a product, deteriorates. Failures can thus occur without becoming incidents.

## The importance of having a "complete kit" of indicators
We record the values of these indicators because Lean is about metrics - we cannot fix what we cannot detect.

## Guarantee indicators for the management of a service without losses
A service must have 2 things:
- Utility - provide value was not previously available
- Guarantee - provide this value while operating within acceptable ranges for:
    - availability (lack of access issues)
    - continuity (lack of incidents)
    - capacity (lack of performance issues)
    - security (lack of safety problems)
