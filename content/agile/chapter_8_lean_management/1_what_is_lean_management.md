# What is Lean Management?
This is a methodology that seeks to identify wastes and inefficiencies and remove them if it is feasible to do so - every organization needs to use Lean as they all have imperfections in resource management.

## Basic principles of Lean thinking
- value - we seek to maximize value delivered to customers (internal such as workers in the value stream and external such as consumers)
- value stream - this is the set of activities needed to transform materials and information into the finished product or service that the customer uses or experiences
- stream - this is the set of all activities that may or may not add value to the product or service. Identifying the activities that lead to waste within this stream is essential to removing inefficiencies
- pull system - the customer pulls the value through their demand, manufacturers and service providers cannot push the value. For example, customers demand better cars, the car companies decide they will make more efficient and prettier cars for regular people, they ask for better materials from the suppliers, etc.
- perfection - the goal is to eliminate all waste and thus produce pure value - this is done through the 3 fundamental tools: continuous improvement, standardization of processes and an action plan
- transparency - the flow of information between relevant bodies is essential to maximizing value and eliminating wastage
- training - we need to train people in order to have the best human resources available in the fight against wastage
