# Muda or Waste
According to Lean, whatever does not add value is waste a.k.a. muda.

## The 3 M's
These are Muda, Muri and Mura:
- Muda (value not added/*Wastefulness*):
    - Type 1 - actions that do not add value to the product or service but are absolutely necessary for the organization
    - Type 2 - actions that neither add value nor are necessary to obtain the product or service
    - there are 8 types of wastes that cause value stream interruptions: overproduction, waiting or downtime, unnecessary transport, over-processing, excess inventory, excess of motion, quality defects, talent (wasted employee creativity)
- Muri (work overload of personnel of machinery/*Overload*)
- Mura (uneven or irregular work and value stream movements/*Imbalance*)

## Causes for difficulty in identifying unproductive activity
- waste is hidden
- waste has become the norm with companies covering it up without addressing the root cause
- lack of training of workers and managers in identifying them
- issues in quantifying waste leading to lack of awareness of money lost
- some production systems are focused on individual improvement and neglect improvement of the system as a whole
- people not knowing how their work affects others and not feeling any accountability in their contribution to the overall value stream

Companies that do encourage continuous improvement:
- learn to see and make problems visible
- know how to attack the problems where and when they happen
- the lessons learned are shared throughout the company to avoid recurrences
