# Just-In-Time, Jidoka and PDCA
The two pillars of the Lean approach: Just-In-Time (JIT) and Jidoka. The tools are continuous improvement(Kaizen), standardized work interactions and action plan (PDCA).

JIT is a production system that manufactures and delivers just what is needed, when needed and in the quantity needed - the inventory lack excesses.

## Jidoka
This is based on providing machinery with a system that detects failure or anomaly in production - this ensures quality and prevents loss of time due to quality control by machinery workers. The root cause is addressed and this prevents future recurrence.

The steps are:
- a problem is located (automatically by sensors)
- line production is stopped momentarily
- quick solutions are established to correct the effects of the problem - this allows for production to be resumed as we diagnose the issue
- the root causes of the problem are investigated and a definitive solution is implemented

The problems can come from the machinery itself or from the people operating the machinery.

## PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
This is also known as a Deming Cycle. It is used for continuous improvement - we propose a change, measure the effects of the change, control the results and execute corrective actions.

It can be related to the DIKW approach:
- Data
- Information
- Knowledge
- Wisdom

The 7 steps in the improvement cycle are:
1. identify the improvement strategy (what we want to improve)
2. define what must be measured to carry out this strategy
3. capture the data (carry out measurements)
4. process the data, eliminating incorrect readings, erroneous data, exceptions, etc.
5. analyze the information:
    - does the data show trends
    - can conclusions be drawn about its evolution over time
    - are there relevant indicators that can be interpreted
6. present and use the information - according to the conclusions obtained, express them in a simple way and present them to the people who must make the decisions
7. implement the improvements - if so decided, invest the resources in the implementation of the best decisions based on the conclusions presented
