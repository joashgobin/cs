# Toyota Production System and Lean Startup
Tarsi Ono was Toyota's director of production and contributed:
- small batch production, previously considered to be uneconomical
- modification of machine changeover procedures to produce an increasing variety with smaller batches
- Kaizen - constant improvement to reduce production and labour costs, and increase quality
- the 7 "wastes" (Muda)
- Kanban for inventory management to control the supply chain, which includes the labelling of components (similar to barcodes today)

The objectives of DPs are:
- define the value desired by the customer for each product or service
- identify those activities that add utility (value) to a product throughout the value stream or chain
- make production and value flow seamlessly and continuously
- implement *pull flow* according to the customer demand in order to avoid overproduction
- accelerate the improvement cycle, aiming for perfection

## Lean Startup
This uses Lean philosophy to launch new companies in a market. We eliminate activities and other forms of waste in order to produce a minimum viable product. This can mean paying for DevOps instead of handling it in-house, or hiring contract workers to create a prototype.

We build a product, measure the data and learn new ideas - rinse and repeat until we get a result that is commercially viable.
