# Iteration Planning
The steps we take in planning an iteration are:
- We consider the requirements
- We forget about the story points associated with these requirements
- We divide the requirements into tasks
- We decide on the number of hours we will allot to the completion of each task - usually by way of a vote (some teams use planning poker but this can be a waste of time)
- If a task has too many hours, we divide the task up into its constituent parts and plan for each of these tasks instead
- We create cards for each task and add them to the Kanban board

Remember that we make tasks small in order to reduce the risk associated with not completing that task - if a task is very large, it is less likely that we will complete it in the allotted time box and we waste the work done as only when a task is completed does it add business value to the customer.

It would be better to put "complete the title, aim and materials sections" and "complete the results table and discussion questions" as tasks for a day than it is to put "complete the lab guide". If we finish the title, aim and materials section section without completing the results table and discussion questions then we at least can deliver some value to our students - they can begin writing their lab reports from those few complete sections rather than having to wait for you to post the complete lab guide.

## Comparing estimated hours and actual hours
It will be useful for us to have look back and compare the number of hours we thought would be sufficient for the work we planned and the actual number of hours it took to complete that work.

We may think that a requirement with 2 story points will take 10 hours and then the work actually takes 12 hours. This means that we should consider adjusting the number of hours associated with a story point to 12 hours or somewhere reasonably around this value.

We can calculate the actual velocity of the project from the actual number of hours required to complete the work.
