# Executing and Closing Iterations
An iteration is finished when all of the tasks have been moved to the "done" state. This means that all of the cards on the Kanban board have been moved from the leftmost column to the rightmost column. When the tasks are done, the requirements for that iteration will have been fulfilled - if not, this means that the iteration's planning was incorrectly executed (some essential tasks were left out).

If the tasks planned for the iteration have been completed ahead of time, we use the remaining time in the current iteration to plan the next iteration and do any polishing.

If the time box is insufficient to complete a requirement (some tasks were not completed on time), we cannot deliver on that requirement (an incomplete requirement does not generate business value).
