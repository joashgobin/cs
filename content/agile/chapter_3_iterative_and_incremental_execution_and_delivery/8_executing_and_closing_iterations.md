# Executing and Closing Iterations
An iteration is finished when all of the tasks have been moved to the "done" state. This means that all of the cards on the Kanban board have been moved from the leftmost column to the rightmost column. When the tasks are done, the requirements for that iteration will have been fulfilled - if not, this means that the iteration's planning was incorrectly executed (some essential tasks were left out).

If the tasks planned for the iteration have been completed ahead of time, we use the remaining time in the current iteration to plan the next iteration and do any polishing.

If the time box is insufficient to complete a requirement (some tasks were not completed on time), we cannot deliver on that requirement (an incomplete requirement does not generate business value).

## Daily meetings
These usually last at most 15 minutes and all of the team members attend. The work team meets and discuss the progress of the work so far. The members modify the Kanban board to reflect the current state of the work. Each person informs the team of what work they did in the previous 24 hours, what work they will be doing in the next 24 hours and any issues encountered.

## Closing an iteration
The end of an iteration is marked by the end of its time box. If there are any unfinished requirements, we do not present on them in the demo - there was a fault in the planning of the iteration, we do not extend the time box to finish a requirement. We simply advance the pending tasks to the next iteration.
