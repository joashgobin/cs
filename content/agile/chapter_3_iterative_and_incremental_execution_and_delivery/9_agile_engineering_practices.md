# Agile Engineering Practices
We apply agile where there is a high concentration of knowledge workers - engineering, UI/UX, software engineering, education, etc. This article focuses on some recommended engineering practices that will help in agile projects.

## Simple design
We design by subtraction - if a feature does not add business value to the customer then there is no use in including it just as *gold plating* as this is a sure way to waste time, effort and money

## Refactoring
We change the internal workings of a system or product so that it performs better without deviating from its usual function. Something as simple as rewriting a method for a lab (to make it more approachable to students) can be considered as refactoring.

## Test-driven development (TDD)

## Unit testing
Here is where we test every component in a system to ensure we minimize wastage and achieve the desired effect - a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.

## Continuous integration
We put systems in place to automate the integration of new parts of a system. We do not wait until we have many changes backed up before we hurry to make patches.

## Pair programming
Two pairs of eyes are better than one.

## Technical debt
This is the cost incurred by the additional work required to produce and maintain a system. These tasks do not add business value to the product or system. Some examples of technical debt are:
- refactoring old code
- analyzing the performance of an algorithm
- writing a manual on how to use an app despite its usage already being intuitive
- writing unit tests for a software product
