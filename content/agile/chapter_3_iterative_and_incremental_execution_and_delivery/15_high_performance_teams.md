# High Performance Teams
A team can be thought of as a group of persons that share a common goal and complement each other in skill and hold each other accountable. There are usually experts who specialize in a certain area but there can also be general specialists who can switch roles to improve the rate of work where bottlenecks may appear.

Team members share a common goal and encourage and support each other when help is warranted. They also serve to ensure that the goal is achieved and counsel members who may lose sight of the goal. We can positively influence our teams by:
- creating a shared vision - this motivates the team to start early and share ownership of the outcome
- setting realistic goals - to prevent ambiguity which will lead to wasted work and over-analyzing
- creating small teams - these can communicate with each other better and more easily share knowledge
- developing a sense of team identity - this builds loyalty as each person can see themselves as a meaningful part of the greater whole
- providing strong leadership - direct the team and support them when they need it

High performance teams are:
- self-organizing
- empowered to make decisions
- convinced that no problem is too large
- committed to the team's success
- based on consensus
- build to encourage as well as outlast regular constructive disagreement amongst the team members

## Dysfunctional teams
Some qualities of such teams are:
- lack of trust
- fear of conflict
- lack of commitment
- lack of responsibility and accountability amongst teammates
- lack of attention to results

## Team motivation
Money is not enough to motivate team members for very long, regardless of how high the pay is. People would rather work for a mid-range salary and be at peace than have a high salary with consistent issues and discouragement at work.

There are multiple levels of motivation:
- resistance
- passive compliance
- active participation
- commitment and dedication
- passionate motivation

We can think of the direction of the project as the resultant of the various motivations of the individual members. We can integrate the various motivations of the members into the project plan. In this way, teammates see the positive outcomes of the project being in some way beneficial to their own motivations/objectives.
