# Alternative Ways to Estimate and Plan
Another way to estimate the work, besides story points, is in hours. This does require expert knowledge on implementation details but it cuts out having to think abstractly about the number of points and how many hours each point needs to be.

As for planning, we try to be more flexible and less predictive in preparing for large goals. We put less at risk if we plan a little and execute quickly compared to planning everything and executing it all. In backward planning, we start with the end goal and backtrace the steps that it will take to achieve that goal until we find a fitting place to start working - this is very useful when we lack sufficient information to prepare a project roadmap but need to start work as soon as possible.

Predictive planning is only beneficial when we have a lot of information about the future of a project.
