# Review Meetings a.k.a. Demos
After we have completed the work in an iteration, it is important that we demonstrate what we have accomplished to the project stakeholders. This is because it is the stakeholders, not the work team, who ultimately determine whether something has business value or not. From the demo, the team can gain useful insights and adjust the project plans to suit any deviations from what was originally intended.
