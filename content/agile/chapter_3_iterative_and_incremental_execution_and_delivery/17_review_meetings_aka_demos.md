# Review Meetings a.k.a. Demos
After we have completed the work in an iteration, it is important that we demonstrate what we have accomplished to the project stakeholders. This is because it is the stakeholders, not the work team, who ultimately determine whether something has business value or not. From the demo, the team can gain useful insights and adjust the project plans to suit any deviations from what was originally intended.

The demo is focused on the product - what has been accomplished by the team, not how we accomplished it.

## Preparing the demo
In preparing for the demo we:
- identify the stories which have been completed within the iteration
- identify which stories have not been completed and what prevented their completion
- decide on the persons from the team who will report on each requirement
- prepare the data and the location for the reporting process
- prepare a strategy to report on the requirements as quickly as possible

## Conducting the demo
We show the work completed to the business, sponsor and other stakeholders and listen to and document their feedback. If we have the user stories at hand, the backside (with the acceptance criteria) can be used to get a script for the demo.

We show the product/system and demonstrate that these acceptance criteria have been achieved. The user stories served to guide the team in what work to do and now they serve as reference points for the demo.

## Best practices
- Verify that the product/system is working properly prior to the demo - ensure that it satisfies the requirements
- Validate that the acceptance criteria can be demonstrated repeatedly without fail

In the demo, a requirement can be rejected by the stakeholders and thus we exclude it from the project. A requirement can be modified in which case we must create a new version of the requirement for a later iteration.
