# Retrospective Meetings
This is where the work team meets and discusses the results of the previously completed iteration and the demo:
- what we accomplished
- what we did not accomplished, if any
- what time was left over, if any
- interactions and actions of the work team
- interactions and actions of the business people
- what problems may have caused the work to slow down, if any
- what practices should be avoided because they led to wastage of time or resources
- what to consider for the next iteration

A retrospective may consist of 5 stages:
- setting the stage (5%)
- collecting the data (30%-50%)
- generating conclusions (20%-30%)
- deciding next steps (15%-20%)
- closing the retrospective (10%-15%)

## Setting the stage
- registration - each member pastes a sticky note, with how they feel, on a panel
- focus ON/focus OFF - we decide if the meeting will be a focused session or a laid back gathering
- ESVP - members in the team will fall into one of four categories:
    - explorers - come to contribute
    - shoppers - come to listen
    - vacationers - come to relax
    - prisoners - come to wait for the meeting to end

- work agreements - we arrange ourselves into small work groups, each group preparing for a specific topic

## Collecting the data
We can create a timeline of the list of events (whether good or problematic) e.g. the server stopped working, the user interface designer got sick, we could not resolve an external issue. We can color code the different events to make it easier to visualize and understand where issues may have occurred.

## Generating conclusions
We can:
- brainstorm - Some techniques for brainstorming are "Free for all", Round Robin and Silence time
- five why's - Why couldn't we finish this user story? Why couldn't we deliver on time? Why did the task not progress on the day planned? Why was a certain team member not available? Why aren't the other members aware of their absence?
- stop doing, start doing, keep doing - list the practices that can be placed into these 3 categories
- SMART objectives - our objectives should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and timely
- retrospective planning game - We ask "if we had to do the same iteration all over again, what would we do the same way and what would we do differently?"
- question circle - the team members participate in a Q&A session and decide on a consensus based on the answers

## Closing the retrospective
- Plus/Delta - We decide on actionable steps we can take and will consider in the next retrospective
- ROTI (Return of Time Invested) - We consider how useful the retro meetings are, what conclusions we can draw and if we have to apply a different approach or technique in the next retro. We consider these insights compared to the time invested
- acknowledgements - We thank everyone for their attendance and their contributions to the retro

The retro helps us to create information radiators that can be used by the team in future iterations.
