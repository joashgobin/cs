# Information Radiators
One of the most valued tenets of agile is the easy access of easily readable information. This is achieved by information radiators - these are panels and diagrams in the office or online space that make information easily accessible to the work team and other interested parties.

## Card size and format
For the panels, we usually use cards. These cards have information on one side and an adhesive on the other side (e.g. cards on the Kanban board).
- Cards must be large enough for easy handling
- The colors of the cards can indicate the person responsible for a task as in the Kanban board or the type of information as on a timeline board for an iteration in the retrospective meeting where red cards indicate a delay or issue and green cards indicate a good event
- The order of a card can indicate its priority as in the backlog or its chronological order as in the timeline board of the retro meeting
- Cards which are related can be placed in close proximity to each other or even connected with string

## Information radiators in retrospective meetings
A simple table where we have the columns as "Start doing", "Stop doing" and "Keep doing" can serve as an information radiator for a retro meeting. We can even columns for "Do less" and "Do more".
