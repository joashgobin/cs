# Project Closure
The project requires the work to be completed before we can consider it as finished. It also requires us to close any commitments like pending risks, archived documents, people released for other projects, practices to carry over to future projects, practices to get rid of due to their contribution to wastage and acceptance of the product/system by the stakeholders.

We get the final approval of the client and ensure that the requirements are met. We also prepare performance reports for the project to help us analyze to what degree the project was successful. We archive the records of the project for future reference and we release the personnel involved in the work team.

## Lessons learnt
We always keep record of projects and details of the client for the sake of future work to be done in similar areas or with the same client or clients with similar interests, constraints and goals.

## Efficiency throughout the agile project life cycle
An effective team is great in their communication:
- top-down - from owner to work team
- bottom-up - from work team to owner
- horizontal - from teammate to teammate

*"I thought that..."* could be an indicator of poor communication between and within the parties involved be it the work team or stakeholders. When information is not flowing through the team or is ambiguous to the team members, it is the project leader who has to fix this. Team members need to ask questions instead of making assumptions if a task or requirement is unclear.

Mistakes will be made and we cannot depend on luck to resolve issues. We need to fix the communication if we are to have successful projects.
