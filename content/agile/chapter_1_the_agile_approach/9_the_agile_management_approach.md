# The Agile Management Approach
Agile is not perfect but it can be used in conjunction with more traditional management techniques to
maximize the business value that can be delivered by the work team.
- Agile is more suitable for industries where change is guaranteed
- The traditional (waterfall) method is more static
- A project's most important assets are its human resources - people working together and contributing their ideas
- Agile is about creating business value, not checking off boxes based on what the client
may want
- A **backlog** is the list of requirements that need to be completed in order to deliver business value
- The *purpose of the backlog* is to measure the value created not the work done
- There is no project manager so the work team can organize their own activities based on 
the capabilities and availability of group members
- This backlog will change as the project progresses - because we need just enough information in order to
begin a task, the backlog will never truly be empty due to the ease with which we define requirements
- Iterations are geared towards having short bursts of addition of business value to a product
- Face-to-face communication is prized
- Meetings must serve to update the work team but not be too long or require much prep time because such an
environment is sure to make the work team detest agile
- Information radiators such as kanban boards are used instead of information coolers such as
Gantt charts
- We respect time boxes and their corresponding tasks
