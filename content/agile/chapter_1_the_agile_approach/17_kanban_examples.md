# Examples of Kanban Boards
A good kanban effectively represents:
- who is working on a task
- how many tasks each person has (each person has a different color of card)
- the number of tasks at each stage of production
- the places where there are *bottlenecks* in the work
- if the work in progress (WIP) limit has been reached for a certain stage

## Digital kanban boards
These give us the advantage of helping team members in remote locations collaborate on a project.
They are usually accessible via apps on mobile devices thus increasing accessibility and ease of use.

They however can introduce technical overhead in having to train team members to navigate and use them.
It is still preferable to have a board in the office where team members can simply glance at and understand the
progress of work instead of having to open an app and navigate to the board.

## Varying the design of kanban boards
Kanban boards are easy to use but there is no single design that will serve every project so we must
expect the visual layout to change.
