# Synergy of Agile Methodologies
We can use various agile methodologies together in order to get the results from a project. 
- Scrum helps us to have useful meetings, understand our respective roles, keep track of artifacts, etc.
- XP (eXtreme Programming) teaches us to have continuous delivery, high standards for our code, simplicity, etc.
- Kanban helps us to organize work and prevent bottlenecks by allowing us to easily 
where work is moving a steady pace versus slowing down.
- Lean trains us to think about where wastage can occur and to plug any holes that 
negatively affect our efficiency - we only do what is useful.

In agile projects, the scope is determined by the cost and schedule. We as agile leaders
must seek to allow people to organize themselves and their work rather than directing them like a project manager. We favour the 4 agile 4 values and the 12 agile principles, all contributing to the agility of the projects we complete.
