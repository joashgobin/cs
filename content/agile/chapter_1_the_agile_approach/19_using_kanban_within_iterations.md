# Using Kanban Within Iterations
Each iteration in agile involves executing the tasks planned for it. The team organizes the work
within itself and collaborates to complete these tasks. The way we use rows and columns 
in kanban is not fixed yet we can look at the board and tell a lot of information 
(e.g. who is assigned to a task, how many tasks are completed, etc.).

The kanban board is useful because of how easily it allows us to view the state of work in the project.

## Rules for kanban boards
- one task to one person
- tasks only move left to right
- the number of tasks in a column should not exceed the number of persons on the team (this could mean that work slowing)
- other rules around the maximum number of simultaneous tasks a member of the team can have at any time are also used to prevent an uneven distribution of the workload
