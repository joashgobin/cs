# Framework of Methodologies
The stages involved in the cascade/waterfall/traditional methodologies are:
>Analyze > Plan > Design > Build > Test > Deploy

All stages serve to produce the final product, whether or not business value is maximized.

For the agile approach, we do the following:
>Analyze > Plan > (Design - Build - Test) > Deploy > Rinse and Repeat

The main focus is on maximizing business value and improving the product on each iteration.

Both approaches have their merits - agile in its ability to deliver value and traditional in its
ability to have set boundaries in what is encouraged by the parties involved (for example, a project
is not allowed to go on forever in the traditional approach).

## XP (extreme programming)
This is based on 13 engineering practices.
Level 1:
- whole team
- customer tests
- planning game
- small releases

Level 2:
- collective ownership
- coding standard
- continuous integration
- sustainable pace
- metaphor

Level 3:
- test-driven development (TDD)
- pair programming
- refactoring
- simple design

## Kanban
Kanban is methodology and a tool. Work is broken down into small tasks and the team moves
the sticky notes for each task across the kanban board from left to right as the work progresses.
The project backlog is the leftmost column and the rightmost column is filled with complete tasks.

With kanban, we need to have Work in Process (WIP) limits for each column so that to
prevent the work team from engaging in too many tasks at the same time. Kanban is an
information cooler as it allows us to see the state of work with a quick glance.

## Crystal
This family of methodologies are easy to pick up and focus on two parameters:
- criticality of the project and 
- team size

This methodology is designed to accommodate various traits of a work team:
- face-to-face is better
- people have issues with consistency
- people vary based on time and place
- people can be proactive

## Ad-hoc methodologies
These are make-shift methodologies for a certain time and place. The team decides to adopt
traditional and agile practices to overcome a specific scenario (process tailoring).
