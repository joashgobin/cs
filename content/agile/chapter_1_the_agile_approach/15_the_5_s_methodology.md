# The 5 S's Methodology
This is designed to improve the productivity of employees as they no longer waste time 
in technical overhead tasks such as searching for tools, documents, etc. These items are organized 
in a manner which makes them easy to find and return. It is focused on minimizing losses.

The 5 S's are:
- Seiri (classify) - store related items and resources in close proximity e.g. books are stored separate from building tools
- Seiton (order) - store these items in a discernible order e.g. arrange books by their names alphabetically
- Seiso (clean) - keep what is necessary; get rid of items we don't need e.g. remove old tools which are irrelevant to our job
as they can make finding the relevant tools harder 
- Seiketsu (keep) - maintain order and cleanliness regularly; the longer we put off these two activities, the more
time will have to be invested to fix our workspace later
- Shitsuke (discipline) - stick to a plan that promotes keeping the workspace in a clean and ordered state

These principles not only apply to physical items but also software products. We make a conscious effort to reorganize our files, user interface elements
and code in a way that makes it intuitive to find them e.g. you wouldn't put the button to play your game in the settings menu or place code for a webpage
in a folder named *database*. 

In software development, the work done in cleaning up the code base is referred to as **technical debt**.

## The importance of teamwork
The 5 S's cannot be effectively implemented if the entire team participates in it. If one person
refuses to clean their side of the office then the office remains cluttered in that area
and the documents available there will be hard to find.

The same idea goes for a code base. The *tactical tornadoes* are the programmers that implement features
at a very fast rate but do not put efforts into refactoring and maintaining the quality of the code.
The result is that the rest of the team incurs technical debt in doing the refactoring for code they did not
write (and thus take more time to understand before they can refactor it).

### Group vs. function vs. team
Distinguishing among these is very important:
- group - a set of persons sharing a common trait e.g. men under 40, students in form 5
- function - a group of people who complete a common set of tasks e.g. janitors at a school, coders working on a website
- team - a group of people with a common goal despite having differing tasks to complete

In a team, the goal is the most important thing. The 5 S's will not succeed if there is a group or a function.
