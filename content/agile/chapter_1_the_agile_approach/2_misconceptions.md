# Misconceptions
The agile approach is used when we are not aware of the scope of a project,
are unclear about the requirements or are sure that changes will happen during
the project lifetime.

## Why agile exists
The agile approach was developed because the traditional assumes the following 
most of which are often not the case in a project:
- The client is sure about what they want
- The work team know exactly how to produce the desired end result from the start
- When a plan is made, there will be no deviations from it 

Clients are often unsure of the desired outcome, the work team usually needs to try
various processes in order to find the best one and plans for a project can change quite often.

## Business value comes first
Delivering business value is our number one priority in the agile approach. Completing 
all of the planned features is important but it is not necessary to wait until a
project is complete before we can add value to our customers.

For example, a login page for a website might be an important feature but that should
not prevent us from making the home page and about page of the website available for
our customers to view.

The traditional approach would have us prioritize finishing the project over adding value
to the lives of our customers. Also, completing a checklist of features doesn't guarantee
that your customers will be satisfied. That is why agile emphasizes the effective use of feedback.

A minimum viable product (MVP) delivers more business value than no product.

## The value gained from agile
A partial product can be used to attract sponsors and to encourage investors and stakeholders, can be tested and validated,
allows us to take the project in a differet direction in the case of the current state
being undesirable to the client.

By focusing on business value first, we can have a project that welcomes change rather than
one that will be crippled by change.
