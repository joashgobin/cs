# Agile Work Process for Projects
Agile can be used to manage projects, products, services and teams. This article discusses
the average work process for an agile project. It is NOT a blueprint to be used for every
type of agile project.

## Work process
The general steps involved are:
1. Feasibility study - the creation of a *business case* to validate the undertaking of a project
2. Project letter - to authorize use of company resources and to indicate the official commencement of the project.
It consists of:
- Formal authorization of start
- Initial requirements and the project's high-level objectives
- Definition of the criteria for the project to be considered complete
3. Project charter - we begin by asking who is the product for
4. Personas - these are the archetypes of the users of our product
5. Requirements - are usually written as user stories and form a list we refer to as the
project backlog/requirement stack; prioritization is done based on the business value each requirement
brings; some methods are **MoSCoW** and **Kano**
6. Project roadmap - divides the project into iterations
7. Planning poker (this is very problematic in reality because team members can find it stressful
to assign points to tasks for which we may not know the amount of work involved)
8. Designing delivery packages (deciding which tasks to do first after factoring in technical dependencies)
9. Plan the 1st iteration
10. Execute the first iteration
11. Demo/review of the results of the 1st iteration
12. Retrospective on the 1st iteration
13. Rinse and repeat

## Parties defined in the agile approach
- Product owner/client - decides what adds business value and doesn't
- Work team - decides what work will be done and in what order
- Facilitator - acts as a middle man for the two other parties
