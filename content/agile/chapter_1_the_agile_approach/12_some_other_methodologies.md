# Some Other Methodologies
The following are some other methodologies.

## Feature-Driven Development (FDD)
This is an ad-hoc methodology that arranges the planning of features to be developed in a chronological
order as we do in a traditional approach but each feature is produced through iteration and
increment as in agile.

The planning of the required features happens at the beginning of the project and
we use agile practices to build out the product or system - the work is divided up
into smaller components to be created and tested and is organized into multiple sprints.
The following are some characteristics of FDD:
- modelling the work domain
- dividing the requirements into smaller requirements
- forming smaller groups from the work team, each of which create a potential design
for the product or system and the team chooses the best aspects of each design
- inspecting the product or system regularly
- managing configurations of all aspects of the system
- having the progress readily available for inspection

FDD is known for its *parking diagrams* used to keep track of work progress.

## Dynamic Systems Development Management (DSDM)
This is another ad-hoc approach which involves the usual stages/milestones of the traditional
approach (feasibility study, design, etc.) but each stage is a miniature agile project
in which we iterate and increment in order to complete the requirements of that stage.

It has eight (8) principles which were created prior to the publishing of the Agile Manifesto:
1. Focus on business need
2. Deliver products on time
3. Collaborate
4. Never compromise of quality
5. Build incrementally, starting with firm steps
6. Develop iteratively
7. Communicate continuously and clearly
8. Make your control visible

## Lean
This approach is not agile or traditional or even ad-hoc. It is a universal philosophy that
can be applied to any project: **do what works, don't do what doesn't**. Lean is about
minimizing wastage of assets available to the work team especially time.

In Lean, we identifying weak points and fix them as quickly as possible. This elimination
of wastage will aggregate over time even if the difference is not seen immediately:

>Ideas > Build Product > Measure > Data > Learn > Repeat

Such a philosophy, when applied over the lifetimes of multiple projects can help to
set your company or team apart from the competition. Lean has seven (7) core concepts:
- Eliminate waste
- Empower the team
- Deliver fast
- Optimize the whole (excellence from the team is excellence in every project)
- Ensure quality is intrinsic to our work (we build with quality rather than check
the quality at the end)
- Delay decisions (do not predetermine the steps involved in completing the work; 
let the work evolve as more is completed)
- Amplify learning (the work team values and prioritizes communication and feedback)
