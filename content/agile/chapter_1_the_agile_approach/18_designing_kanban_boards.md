# Designing Kanban Boards
The principles behind designing kanban boards are:
- keep working the same way - kanban should not affect the way we work, only help us to keep track of it
- have incremental changes - teams using kanban should understand the iterative and incremental nature kanban
- each member is a leader - each teammate works to facilitate change on the board
- have continuous and collaborative improvement - we look for *bottlenecks* (places where the WIP limit has been reached)
and clear up these blockages to improve the flow of work
- make the process clear to everyone - focus on ensuring that everyone has an explicit understanding of the 
work to be done and how it will be completed
- limit the work in progress (WIP) - this will prevent teammates from being overwhelmed with work
- make the work visible - show work to the client as quickly as possible
- visualize the workflow - use the kanban as a means of visualizing the work done and to be done
- manage the workflow - we identify places the cards are not moving at a steady pace and concentrate efforts 
to improve the flow in those places

## Key information on a kanban board
1. status - the current column a task is in should be obvious; avoid vague columns like "To-do", "Doing" and "Done"
2. partial state - we divide each column into two (2) sub-columns "Working" and "Complete" to account for tasks which 
have been completed for a certain phase/column but we have not pushed them into the next phase/column
3. personnel - the board indicates who is doing what
4. tasks for each requirement - a requirement is "done" (complete) when all of the tasks (cards) under it are on the rightmost column
5. dependencies between requirements - wool threads can be used to indicate which panels are dependent on others to be completed first; 
the outline colour of the panels of digital boards can be used to show dependencies; the simplest way is to place the sections from top to bottom according
to importance (e.g. writing a lab manual for a science lab should be above conducting the lab with your students)
6. dependencies between tasks - within each requirement (section of the board) we can place the more important tasks (cards) first
7. errors/delays - we place an error section on the board for tasks where the errors are encountered 
for example if it is discovered that the teammate assigned to a task lacks the knowledge to complete it or where the task might have to be divided
into smaller subtasks for completion by other teammates
8. dependencies with third parties - we use a special color for tasks that depend on personnel and processes
outside of our team; the facilitator works to resolve these external dependencies and unblock the work 
9. estimated time for each task - we write the time expected to complete a task on its card
10. time incurred in a task - after a task is complete we write the time taken to complete the task on the card
11. multiple projects -
