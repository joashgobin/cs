# The Agile Approach
The agile approach has many features which differ from the traditional approach.

## De-centralized management
There is no dedicated project manager in agile. The team assigns the work to members
as it sees fit. They do not depend on or wait for a single person to organize and assign
tasks.

## Welcoming change
Agile projects adapt to change rather than work to avoid them. What delivers business
value to the customer is subject to change so it is wiser to have an approach that caters for
deviations than one that expends resources to prevent deviations.

## Focus on people
The knowledge and experiences of the people involved in the project are what drive 
the project forward. Even the completion of the project is understood as the delivery
of more and more business value to the customer. Completion is not just checking off boxes.

## Iterations and increments
Meeting the requirements of the customer is achieved through short repetitions (*iterations*), each
iteration either serving to increase (*increment*) the business value of the product or, in the case
of the work done not giving desirable results, to give the team useful insights as to where
to take the project instead.

## Quick return on investment (ROI)
Because agile projects produce a partial product early, ROI happens very early and 
throughout the lifetime of the project. This ROI may not be in the form of income but rather
the tangible deliverable itself. The product can be validated and used to improve
future iterations. Work itself is an investment so having a system where at most a few
days of work is wasted compared to a year is better. Work saved is money saved.

## Small teams
A team leader is not necessary in agile. The work is organized and completed by the team.
Dedicated management is absent so our teams remain small. The smaller groups formed within the
team will also be based on how individuals will need to communicate daily thus these groups
will be smaller.

## Lower risk
If small and frequent iterations are made on the product and feedback is gained from the client 
frequently, any wasteful work will be minimized and we will eliminate the chances of
the final product being undesirable to the client/target demographic.
