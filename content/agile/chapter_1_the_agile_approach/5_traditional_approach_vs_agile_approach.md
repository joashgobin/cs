# Traditional Approach vs. Agile Approach
The agile approach has the following advantages over the traditional approach:
- De-centralized management style
- Acceptance of change
- Focus on people involved
- Short iterations in work
- Early return on investment (ROI)
- Small work teams

## The triple constraint
Agile flips the triple constraint of scope, schedule and cost upside-down. In a traditional
approach, the project scope is fixed and the schedule and cost change to serve this
scope. Conversely, in agile we have the scope adjusting based on a fixed schedule and cost.
This gives us a lot of flexibility as we do have expend time (*the schedule*) and resources (*the cost*) to achieve some
distant goal (*the scope*) but rather change the end-goal based on the time and resources available
to the team. The total value delivered (the scope) will be optimized in this way.
