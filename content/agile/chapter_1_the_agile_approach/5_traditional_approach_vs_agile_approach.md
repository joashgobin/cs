# Traditional Approach vs. Agile Approach
The agile approach has the following advantages over the traditional approach:
- De-centralized management style
- Acceptance of change
- Focus on people involved
- Short iterations in work
- Early return on investment (ROI)
- Small work teams

## The triple constraint
Agile flips the triple constraint of scope, schedule and cost upside-down. In a traditional
approach, the project scope is fixed and the schedule and cost change to serve this
scope. Conversely, in agile we have the scope adjusting based on a fixed schedule and cost.
This gives us a lot of flexibility as we do not expend time (*the schedule*) and resources (*the cost*) to achieve some
distant end-goal (*the scope*) but rather change this end-goal based on the time and resources available
to the team. The total value delivered (the scope) will be optimized in this way.

## Principles of agile management
- Planning is dispersed throughout the project lifetime instead of being restricted to
the beginning
- Requirements do not need to be too detailed in order for the team to start working
- Collaboration with the client is valued because it is the client who determines what
has busines value and what doesn't
- Student's syndrome is never an issue because the work is distributed evenly instead of
at the end of the project lifetime
- Paralysis by analysis is avoided because we need the requirements to be just clear enough
in order to start. We do not obsess over whether or not we have enough information before
we start
