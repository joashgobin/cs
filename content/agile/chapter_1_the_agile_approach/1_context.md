# Context
The agile approach to project management resulted from a desire to move away from 
traditional methodologies which were unable to match the ever-evolving nature of 
various industries.

## Why is it called agile
We refer to agile project management as **agile** because of its ability to adapt.
*Agile* management *embraces change*.

## Reasons for its success
The traditional project management methodologies:
- are too rigid
- do not cater for changes in requirements along the way
- favour *information coolers* such as **Gantt charts** which require a lot of 
technical knowledge to prepare
- need all requirements to be finalized before starting
- produce TLDR documents at the end of each stage of production

### The agile principles
These are the four(4) principles upon which all of agile management is built:
1. People and their experiences over rigid processes
2. Tangible and usable products over extensive documentation
3. Collaboration with client over contracts
4. Adaptation to change over a rigid plan

In each pair, the latter item is not unnecessary but it is not as important as the former. 
For example, having a working product is more important than a manual (documentation) but we still need
to produce a manual (a document describing how the product should be used).

## Agile methodologies
These are the result of applying the agile principles. It is not necessary to use only
one methodology as one may have its strengths in dealing with certain situations compared to another.

### Examples of agile methodologies
Some agile methodologies are:
- scrum
- kanban
- extreme programming (XP)
- lean


## Advantages of the agile approach
With the agile approach, the team:
- expects change
- favours *information radiators* such as **kanban boards** which require little to
no training in order to use
- allows for project commencement without large amounts of information being known
- only produces documents that will help improve the progress of the project

## Areas where we apply agile
These include but are not limited to:
- research projects
- data science
- software development
- construction e.g. lean construction
