# Adopting Agile
This article is a case for the adoption of the agile appro
ach.

## What agile brings to a project
Business value is seen very quickly in the agile approach.

### Product visibility
We can have a deliverables from very early in the project. These will be visible to
project stakeholders and clients.

### Tangible deliverables
Having a usable product will serve to encourage your project sponsors as well as to provide
valuable feedback through testing and validation.

### Risk management
Having frequent intervals after which we test and validate the product will reduce the
amount of work the team can possibly waste in working on a less than desirable result and
increase the quality of the future iterations.

### Adaptability
A traditional approach would have us expend resources on planning for an ideal future
which, due to the high probability of change, will probably never happen. Agile's 
adaptability helps us to adjust the product to what will bring the most business value.
