# Scrum
Many persons hate scrum because it's overdone in some organizations. It is one of
those "good in theory, not so good in execution". This is due to some people taking
Scrum too seriously. This in turn forces the work team to treat agile as a ritual or
even a religion.

Scrum is:
- Light (it requires very little to be understood before using it)
- Easy to understand (the methodology is open and does not have specific rules)
- Difficult to master (because *Scrum Masters* take it too seriously thus going against
what Scrum is meant to be)

Scrum is related to empirical control processes (knowledge is based on experience and
decision making is based on empirical evidence). Scrum is thus iterative (repeat until good)
and incremental (improve each time).

## Elements of Scrum
The following are some common aspects of Scrum:
- Sprints - fixed intervals of time in which we iterate on the product/system; usually 2
weeks in length but shorter is better
- Definition of Done - the criteria used by the team to say if a requirement/a sprint/a feature is complete
must be properly defined because not doing so will lead the team to do more work than
is necessary or not even delivering the business value in the first place

## The Scrum cycle
A sprint is a fixed interval of time in which we complete tasks in order to fulfill requirements.
Planning is done at the beginning of each sprint to decide which tasks in the backlog to complete.
This means that at the end of each sprint the backlog is updated.

### Scrum products
There are three (3) scrum products/artifacts:
- product increment - a fraction of the final product that still adds business value
- product backlog - a list of requirements, sorted according to their priority
- sprint backlog - a subset of the product requirements to be completed in the current sprint


### Scrum foundations
There are three (3) foundations/pillars:
- transparency - the team and stakeholders have a common view of the project, its goals and full requirements
- inspection - the project's evaluated from its products (product increment, project backlog and sprint backlog)
- adaptation - the team modify the direction of the project based on the current information available to them

### Scrum values
The scrum values in the Agile Manifesto are:
- focus on the result
- motivation
- transparency
- commitment
- respect

## Meetings in Scrum
Scrum is often identified and even disliked because of its various meetings.

### Daily scrum meeting
This is usually 15 minutes in length where the team reflects on the previous 24 hours and plans for the next day. Each team member answers three (3) questions:
- What was done yesterday?
- What will be done today?
- What challenges would prevent me from completing the work for today?

### Sprint review meeting (aka the demo)
This meeting takes place at the end of each sprint. The team updates the product backlog and
evaluate the increase in business value of the product. In this meeting, the team shows the stakeholders
the current progression of the product/system. For month-long sprints, the meeting is usually 4 hours.

### Retrospective sprint meeting
This is different from the demo in that the work team evaluates the previous sprint with respect to progress
in the relationships among people involved, the processes completed and the tools used.
Here we can decide on steps that can be taken to improve the efficiency of our work (processes and tools) and the relations with
stakeholders.

## Roles in Scrum
There are three (3) roles in Scrum:
- the product owner
- the Scrum Master
- the work team

### Product owner
- determines what requirements add business to the product
- decides on the priority of these requirements in the project backlog
- responsible for ensuring that the work team understands these requirements (user stories)
- determines the due dates for the deliverables

### Scrum Master
- works alongside the work team but is not above them in importance
- is the expert on agile methodologies in the team
- improves the work by removing hindrances to the work team and finding solutions to other issues
- is not the same as a business analyst (a middle man between the work team and the product owner)
- serves to facilitate the relationship between the work team and the product owner

### Work team
- does the work required to fulfill the project requirements
- have the technical expertise to complete these tasks
