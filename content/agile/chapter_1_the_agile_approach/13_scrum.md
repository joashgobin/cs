# Scrum
Many persons hate scrum because it's overdone in some organizations. It is one of
those "good in theory, not so good in execution". This is due to some people taking
Scrum too seriously. This in turn forces the work team to treat agile as a ritual or 
even a religion.

Scrum is:
- Light (it requires very little to be understood before using it)
- Easy to understand (the methodology is open and does not have specific rules)
- Difficult to master (because *Scrum Masters* take it too seriously thus going against
what Scrum is meant to be)

Scrum is related to empirical control processes (knowledge is based on experience and
decision making is based on empirical evidence). Scrum is thus iterative (repeat until good)
and incremental (improve each time).

## Elements of Scrum
The following are some common aspects of Scrum:
- Sprints - fixed intervals of time in which we iterate on the product/system; usually 2
weeks in length but shorter is better
- Definition of Done - the criteria used by the team to say if a requirement/a sprint/a feature is complete
must be properly defined because not doing so will lead the team to do more work than
is necessary or not even delivering the business value in the first place
