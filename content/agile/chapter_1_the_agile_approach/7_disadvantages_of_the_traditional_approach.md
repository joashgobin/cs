# Disadvantages of the Traditional Approach
The agile approach addresses many of the shortcomings of the traditional approach. Of course,
there is no "one-size-fit-all" when it comes to project management. Every aspect of the agile
approach might not be optimal so we leave room for the idea of mixing traditional techniques with agile.

## Context
The following are true:
- Uncertainty is high
- Rate of change is high
- Technology drives industry and technology continues to evolve
- Agile is better suited for these conditions
- The line between *traditional* and *agile* is quickly being blurred

## Solutions from agile
Some core ideas from agile are:
- Work is distributed throughout the project lifetime (no student syndrome)
- Iterations are planned before we do the work involved in each iteration. This allows us to
base the work to be done on the results achieved from previous iterations
- Requirements need to be sufficiently defined, not perfectly defined, before we start working (no paralysis by analysis)
- We start as soon as we have a clear enough definition of requirements
- We collaborate with the client because they determine the business value of the results
- The client helps us to define what to do and what to avoid but not how to do it 

## Agile is not perfect
- While agile may be suitable for most industries filled based on knowledge work, there are certain
cases where the agile approach may be considered as too much and thus unnecessary
- Closing negotiating efforts is necessary in certain settings thus not having the predictive planning
aspect of the traditional approach might be seen as a drawback
- Transitioning from traditional to agile might be incur some costs
- Everyone might not agree with this change in approach
- Some modern agile practices do take quite some time to learn and adopt
- Changing over to an agile approach too quickly might backfire and result in team members having
little appreciation for agile practices
