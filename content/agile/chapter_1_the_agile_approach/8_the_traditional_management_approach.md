# The Traditional Management Approach
Project managers need to be conscious of the circumstances involved in the planning and execution of the project.
Some factors to be considered are:
- The stakeholders' priorities
- Resources available to the team
- Other ways of completing the work
- Impacts and synergies with other projects
- The possibility or unforeseen events and decisions
- The temptation to prematurely compress the work schedule in order to meet deadlines

Remember that in agile, the scope serves the cost and schedule. If we wish to compress
the work schedule then we can:
- execute faster by doing tasks in parallel
- increase the cost slightly in order to put measures in place to allow for faster execution
- reduce the scope if we are biting more than we can chew

## Tips
- There is no manual on perfect project management
- Motivating people involves knowing what their wants and their goals
- Be on the lookout for change because the market is guaranteed to fluctuate
