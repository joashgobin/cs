# The Traditional Management Approach
Project managers need to be conscious of the circumstances involved in the planning and execution of the project.
Some factors to be considered are:
- The stakeholders' priorities
- Resources available to the team
- Other ways of completing the work
- Impacts and synergies with other projects
- The possibility or unforeseen events and decisions
- The temptation to prematurely compress the work schedule in order to meet deadlines
