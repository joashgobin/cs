# Kanban
This is a visual management tool. It is based on the Andon system, meaning "lamp" in Japanese.
It can be considered as part of Lean philosophy where persons implement a set of communication measures
in order to clearly express the current state of work in a productive system.

This type of management can be applied in multiple areas:
- storage
- teams
- maintenance
- offices
- security
- processing/manufacturing

Kanban is a *information radiator* meaning that information is obvious to anyone observing it.
There is no technical overhead or expertise involved in assessing the current amount of work completed by the team.
We can clearly which task is in certain phase or hasn't been started as yet or will be completed soon.

## Using kanban
Kanban as a tool is a task board but as a methodology it is a specific way to use the task board to
push the word forward. The following information should be accessible at a glance:
- task performers - we can see who is responsible for which task
- task status - a task can only be in one column at a time and most moves from left to right
as work is done on it 
- ease of movement - cards can be easily moved from column to column
- start of iteration - all cards begin in the leftmost column
- end of iteration - all cards end up in the rightmost column

## Best practices in using kanban
The following allow us to effectively use kanban:
- one task to one person (tasks are not shared)
- tasks only move left to right 
- a limited number of tasks per column (work in progress (WIP) limits)
- few simultaneous tasks person (a team member can only work on a certain number of tasks at a
time to avoid overload)

### The fixed nature of time boxes
We do not add tasks to the board when the iteration begins. We only add tasks when planning for the
iteration. We keep iterations short to make pivoting the direction of the project easy. The amount of 
work wasted, in the case of the requirements changing, is also small.
We make tasks simple so that the information needed to start them is minimal.
