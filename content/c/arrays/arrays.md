# Arrays
Arrays are a way for us to store many values of a certain datatype under the same name.
Other languages have sets, lists and dictionaries which serve a similar purpose.
This saves us the time and energy of having to create unique names for each value we want to
store.

The format for defining an array is:
~~~c
type array_name[number_of_values];
~~~

## Integer arrays
We can *populate* an integer array by including the values in curly braces:
!{{./populating_an_integer_array.c}}
