# Constructs in C
The normal *execution flow* of a program in C is **sequential execution flow**. 
This means that the program is executed from top to bottom. This is not always 
desirable as we may want certain sections of code to be executed multiple times 
or if one or more conditions are met. This is where *control structures (constructs)*
come in. There are two (2) types of constructs:
- Conditional constructs
- Iterative constructs
