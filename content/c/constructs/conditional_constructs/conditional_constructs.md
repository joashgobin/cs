# Conditional Constructs
In solving a problem, we sometimes want to execute a block of code if one or more conditions are met. 
We use *conditional constructs* in order to specify actions and the criteria required for those actions to be executed.
In C, we have two (2) main conditional constructs:
- If-else statements
- Switch-case statements

## If-Else
!{{./if_else.c}}

## Switch-case
!{{./switch_case.c}}
