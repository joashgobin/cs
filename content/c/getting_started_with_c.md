# Getting Started with C
This is the start of the lessons on the C programming language. C is a compiled, statically-typed,
procedural language.

## Boilerplate
Boilerplate is used to refer to the repetitive sections of code that developers have to type with little to no variation.

Examine the following C code snippet:

!{{./hello.c}}


#### Challenge
Answer the following questions:
- What would you consider to be C boilerplate?
- What is the **stdio.h** referring to?
- Is this header file necessary for every C program?
- What is the function *printf* used for?
- Why do we use the " symbol before and after *Hello world!*?
