# C Home
This is where all of the lessons on the C programming language reside.

## Boilerplate
Boilerplate is considered as the repetitive sections of code that developers have to type often.

Examine the following snippet:

[Hello world!!](./hello.html)

!{{./hello.c}}

!{{./datatypes/double_datatype.c}}

Answer the following questions:
- What would you consider to be C boilerplate? What is the **stdio.h** referring to?
- Is this header file necessary for every C program?
- What is the function *printf* used for?
- Why do we use the " symbol before and after *Hello world!*?

### Math Formula Test
The following formula should be rendered using KaTex:

$$x=\frac{-b\pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

The above formula can be used to find the roots of a quadratic equation (the solutions for $x$).
