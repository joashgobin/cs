<p style='darkgrey;opacity:0.5;font-size:0.6rem'>agile > chapter 1 the agile approach > 2 misconceptions</p><h1>Misconceptions</h1>
<p>The agile approach is used when we are not aware of the scope of a project,
are unclear about the requirements or are sure that changes will happen during
the project lifetime.</p>
<h2>Why agile exists</h2>
<p>The agile approach was developed because the traditional assumes the following
most of which are often not the case in a project:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client is sure about what they want</li>
<li>The work team know exactly how to produce the desired end result from the start</li>
<li>When a plan is made, there will be no deviations from it </li>
</ul>
<p>Clients are often unsure of the desired outcome, the work team usually needs to try
various processes in order to find the best one and plans for a project can change quite often.</p>
<h2>Business value comes first</h2>
<p>Delivering business value is our number one priority in the agile approach. Completing
all of the planned features is important but it is not necessary to wait until a
project is complete before we can add value to our customers.</p>
<p>For example, a login page for a website might be an important feature but that should
not prevent us from making the home page and about page of the website available for
our customers to view.</p>
<p>The traditional approach would have us prioritize finishing the project over adding value
to the lives of our customers. Also, completing a checklist of features doesn't guarantee
that your customers will be satisfied. That is why agile emphasizes the effective use of feedback.</p>
<p>A minimum viable product (MVP) delivers more business value than no product.</p>
<h2>The value gained from agile</h2>
<p>A partial product can be used to attract sponsors and to encourage investors and stakeholders, can be tested and validated,
allows us to take the project in a different direction in the case of the current state
being undesirable to the client.</p>
<p>By focusing on business value first, we can have a project that welcomes change rather than
one that will be crippled by change.</p>
